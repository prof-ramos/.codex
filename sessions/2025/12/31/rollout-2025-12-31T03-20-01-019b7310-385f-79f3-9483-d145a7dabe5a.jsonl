The script automatically configures LibreOffice on first run\n\n## Reading and analyzing data\n\n### Data analysis with pandas\nFor data analysis, visualization, and basic operations, use **pandas** which provides powerful data manipulation capabilities:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read Excel\ndf = pd.read_excel('file.xlsx')  # Default: first sheet\nall_sheets = pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', sheet_name=None)  # All sheets as dict\n\n# Analyze\ndf.head()      # Preview data\ndf.info()      # Column info\ndf.describe()  # Statistics\n\n# Write Excel\ndf.to_excel('output.xlsx', index=False)\n```\n\n## Excel File Workflows\n\n## CRITICAL: Use Formulas, Not Hardcoded Values\n\n**Always use Excel formulas instead of calculating values in Python and hardcoding them.** This ensures the spreadsheet remains dynamic and updateable.\n\n### ❌ WRONG - Hardcoding Calculated Values\n```python\n# Bad: Calculating in Python and hardcoding result\ntotal = df['Sales'].sum()\nsheet['B10'] = total  # Hardcodes 5000\n\n# Bad: Computing growth rate in Python\ngrowth = (df.iloc[-1]['Revenue'] - df.iloc[0]['Revenue']) / df.iloc[0]['Revenue']\nsheet['C5'] = growth  # Hardcodes 0.15\n\n# Bad: Python calculation for average\navg = sum(values) / len(values)\nsheet['D20'] = avg  # Hardcodes 42.5\n```\n\n### ✅ CORRECT - Using Excel Formulas\n```python\n# Good: Let Excel calculate the sum\nsheet['B10'] = '=SUM(B2:B9)'\n\n# Good: Growth rate as Excel formula\nsheet['C5'] = '=(C4-C2)/C2'\n\n# Good: Average using Excel function\nsheet['D20'] = '=AVERAGE(D2:D19)'\n```\n\nThis applies to ALL calculations - totals, percentages, ratios, differences, etc. The spreadsheet should be able to recalculate when source data changes.\n\n## Common Workflow\n1. **Choose tool**: pandas for data, openpyxl for formulas/formatting\n2. **Create/Load**: Create new workbook or load existing file\n3. **Modify**: Add/edit data, formulas, and formatting\n4. **Save**: Write to file\n5. **Recalculate formulas (MANDATORY IF USING FORMULAS)**: Use the recalc.py script\n   ```bash\n   python recalc.py output.xlsx\n   ```\n6. **Verify and fix any errors**: \n   - The script returns JSON with error details\n   - If `status` is `errors_found`, check `error_summary` for specific error types and locations\n   - Fix the identified errors and recalculate again\n   - Common errors to fix:\n     - `#REF!`: Invalid cell references\n     - `#DIV/0!`: Division by zero\n     - `#VALUE!`: Wrong data type in formula\n     - `#NAME?`: Unrecognized formula name\n\n### Creating new Excel files\n\n```python\n# Using openpyxl for formulas and formatting\nfrom openpyxl import Workbook\nfrom openpyxl.styles import Font, PatternFill, Alignment\n\nwb = Workbook()\nsheet = wb.active\n\n# Add data\nsheet['A1'] = 'Hello'\nsheet['B1'] = 'World'\nsheet.append(['Row', 'of', 'data'])\n\n# Add formula\nsheet['B2'] = '=SUM(A1:A10)'\n\n# Formatting\nsheet['A1'].font = Font(bold=True, color='FF0000')\nsheet['A1'].fill = PatternFill('solid', start_color='FFFF00')\nsheet['A1'].alignment = Alignment(horizontal='center')\n\n# Column width\nsheet.column_dimensions['A'].width = 20\n\nwb.save('output.xlsx')\n```\n\n### Editing existing Excel files\n\n```python\n# Using openpyxl to preserve formulas and formatting\nfrom openpyxl import load_workbook\n\n# Load existing file\nwb = load_workbook('existing.xlsx')\nsheet = wb.active  # or wb['SheetName'] for specific sheet\n\n# Working with multiple sheets\nfor sheet_name in wb.sheetnames:\n    sheet = wb[sheet_name]\n    print(f\"Sheet: {sheet_name}\")\n\n# Modify cells\nsheet['A1'] = 'New Value'\nsheet.insert_rows(2)  # Insert row at position 2\nsheet.delete_cols(3)  # Delete column 3\n\n# Add new sheet\nnew_sheet = wb.create_sheet('NewSheet')\nnew_sheet['A1'] = 'Data'\n\nwb.save('modified.xlsx')\n```\n\n## Recalculating formulas\n\nExcel files created or modified by openpyxl contain formulas as strings but not calculated values. Use the provided `recalc.py` script to recalculate formulas:\n\n```bash\npython recalc.py <excel_file> [timeout_seconds]\n```\n\nExample:\n```bash\npython recalc.py output.xlsx 30\n```\n\nThe script:\n- Automatically sets up LibreOffice macro on first run\n- Recalculates all formulas in all sheets\n- Scans ALL cells for Excel errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, etc.)\n- Returns JSON with detailed error locations and counts\n- Works on both Linux and macOS\n\n## Formula Verification Checklist\n\nQuick checks to ensure formulas work correctly:\n\n### Essential Verification\n- [ ] **Test 2-3 sample references**: Verify they pull correct values before building full model\n- [ ] **Column mapping**: Confirm Excel columns match (e.g., column 64 = BL, not BK)\n- [ ] **Row offset**: Remember Excel rows are 1-indexed (DataFrame row 5 = Excel row 6)\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n- [ ] **NaN handling**: Check for null values with `pd.notna()`\n- [ ] **Far-right columns**: FY data often in columns 50+ \n- [ ] **Multiple matches**: Search all occurrences, not just first\n- [ ] **Division by zero**: Check denominators before using `/` in formulas (#DIV/0!)\n- [ ] **Wrong references**: Verify all cell references point to intended cells (#REF!)\n- [ ] **Cross-sheet references**: Use correct format (Sheet1!A1) for linking sheets\n\n### Formula Testing Strategy\n- [ ] **Start small**: Test formulas on 2-3 cells before applying broadly\n- [ ] **Verify dependencies**: Check all cells referenced in formulas exist\n- [ ] **Test edge cases**: Include zero, negative, and very large values\n\n### Interpreting recalc.py Output\nThe script returns JSON with error details:\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"success\",           // or \"errors_found\"\n  \"total_errors\": 0,              // Total error count\n  \"total_formulas\": 42,           // Number of formulas in file\n  \"error_summary\": {              // Only present if errors found\n    \"#REF!\": {\n      \"count\": 2,\n      \"locations\": [\"Sheet1!B5\", \"Sheet1!C10\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Library Selection\n- **pandas**: Best for data analysis, bulk operations, and simple data export\n- **openpyxl**: Best for complex formatting, formulas, and Excel-specific features\n\n### Working with openpyxl\n- Cell indices are 1-based (row=1, column=1 refers to cell A1)\n- Use `data_only=True` to read calculated values: `load_workbook('file.xlsx', data_only=True)`\n- **Warning**: If opened with `data_only=True` and saved, formulas are replaced with values and permanently lost\n- For large files: Use `read_only=True` for reading or `write_only=True` for writing\n- Formulas are preserved but not evaluated - use recalc.py to update values\n\n### Working with pandas\n- Specify data types to avoid inference issues: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', dtype={'id': str})`\n- For large files, read specific columns: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', usecols=['A', 'C', 'E'])`\n- Handle dates properly: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', parse_dates=['date_column'])`\n\n## Code Style Guidelines\n**IMPORTANT**: When generating Python code for Excel operations:\n- Write minimal, concise Python code without unnecessary comments\n- Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations\n- Avoid unnecessary print statements\n\n**For Excel files themselves**:\n- Add comments to cells with complex formulas or important assumptions\n- Document data sources for hardcoded values\n- Include notes for key calculations and model sections\n</skill>"}]}}
