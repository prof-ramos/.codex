When Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\nlicense: Proprietary. LICENSE.txt has complete terms\n---\n\n# DOCX creation, editing, and analysis\n\n## Overview\n\nA user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of a .docx file. A .docx file is essentially a ZIP archive containing XML files and other resources that you can read or edit. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.\n\n## Workflow Decision Tree\n\n### Reading/Analyzing Content\nUse \"Text extraction\" or \"Raw XML access\" sections below\n\n### Creating New Document\nUse \"Creating a new Word document\" workflow\n\n### Editing Existing Document\n- **Your own document + simple changes**\n  Use \"Basic OOXML editing\" workflow\n\n- **Someone else's document**\n  Use **\"Redlining workflow\"** (recommended default)\n\n- **Legal, academic, business, or government docs**\n  Use **\"Redlining workflow\"** (required)\n\n## Reading and analyzing content\n\n### Text extraction\nIf you just need to read the text contents of a document, you should convert the document to markdown using pandoc. Pandoc provides excellent support for preserving document structure and can show tracked changes:\n\n```bash\n# Convert document to markdown with tracked changes\npandoc --track-changes=all path-to-file.docx -o output.md\n# Options: --track-changes=accept/reject/all\n```\n\n### Raw XML access\nYou need raw XML access for: comments, complex formatting, document structure, embedded media, and metadata. For any of these features, you'll need to unpack a document and read its raw XML contents.\n\n#### Unpacking a file\n`python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_directory>`\n\n#### Key file structures\n* `word/document.xml` - Main document contents\n* `word/comments.xml` - Comments referenced in document.xml\n* `word/media/` - Embedded images and media files\n* Tracked changes use `<w:ins>` (insertions) and `<w:del>` (deletions) tags\n\n## Creating a new Word document\n\nWhen creating a new Word document from scratch, use **docx-js**, which allows you to create Word documents using JavaScript/TypeScript.\n\n### Workflow\n1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`docx-js.md`](docx-js.md) (~500 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for detailed syntax, critical formatting rules, and best practices before proceeding with document creation.\n2. Create a JavaScript/TypeScript file using Document, Paragraph, TextRun components (You can assume all dependencies are installed, but if not, refer to the dependencies section below)\n3. Export as .docx using Packer.toBuffer()\n\n## Editing an existing Word document\n\nWhen editing an existing Word document, use the **Document library** (a Python library for OOXML manipulation). The library automatically handles infrastructure setup and provides methods for document manipulation. For complex scenarios, you can access the underlying DOM directly through the library.\n\n### Workflow\n1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`ooxml.md`](ooxml.md) (~600 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for the Document library API and XML patterns for directly editing document files.\n2. Unpack the document: `python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_directory>`\n3. Create and run a Python script using the Document library (see \"Document Library\" section in ooxml.md)\n4. Pack the final document: `python ooxml/scripts/pack.py <input_directory> <office_file>`\n\nThe Document library provides both high-level methods for common operations and direct DOM access for complex scenarios.\n\n## Redlining workflow for document review\n\nThis workflow allows you to plan comprehensive tracked changes using markdown before implementing them in OOXML. **CRITICAL**: For complete tracked changes, you must implement ALL changes systematically.\n\n**Batching Strategy**: Group related changes into batches of 3-10 changes. This makes debugging manageable while maintaining efficiency. Test each batch before moving to the next.\n\n**Principle: Minimal, Precise Edits**\nWhen implementing tracked changes, only mark text that actually changes. Repeating unchanged text makes edits harder to review and appears unprofessional. Break replacements into: [unchanged text] + [deletion] + [insertion] + [unchanged text]. Preserve the original run's RSID for unchanged text by extracting the `<w:r>` element from the original and reusing it.\n\nExample - Changing \"30 days\" to \"60 days\" in a sentence:\n```python\n# BAD - Replaces entire sentence\n'<w:del><w:r><w:delText>The term is 30 days.</w:delText></w:r></w:del><w:ins><w:r><w:t>The term is 60 days.</w:t></w:r></w:ins>'\n\n# GOOD - Only marks what changed, preserves original <w:r> for unchanged text\n'<w:r w:rsidR=\"00AB12CD\"><w:t>The term is </w:t></w:r><w:del><w:r><w:delText>30</w:delText></w:r></w:del><w:ins><w:r><w:t>60</w:t></w:r></w:ins><w:r w:rsidR=\"00AB12CD\"><w:t> days.</w:t></w:r>'\n```\n\n### Tracked changes workflow\n\n1. **Get markdown representation**: Convert document to markdown with tracked changes preserved:\n   ```bash\n   pandoc --track-changes=all path-to-file.docx -o current.md\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify and group changes**: Review the document and identify ALL changes needed, organizing them into logical batches:\n\n   **Location methods** (for finding changes in XML):\n   - Section/heading numbers (e.g., \"Section 3.2\", \"Article IV\")\n   - Paragraph identifiers if numbered\n   - Grep patterns with unique surrounding text\n   - Document structure (e.g., \"first paragraph\", \"signature block\")\n   - **DO NOT use markdown line numbers** - they don't map to XML structure\n\n   **Batch organization** (group 3-10 related changes per batch):\n   - By section: \"Batch 1: Section 2 amendments\", \"Batch 2: Section 5 updates\"\n   - By type: \"Batch 1: Date corrections\", \"Batch 2: Party name changes\"\n   - By complexity: Start with simple text replacements, then tackle complex structural changes\n   - Sequential: \"Batch 1: Pages 1-3\", \"Batch 2: Pages 4-6\"\n\n3. **Read documentation and unpack**:\n   - **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`ooxml.md`](ooxml.md) (~600 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Pay special attention to the \"Document Library\" and \"Tracked Change Patterns\" sections.\n   - **Unpack the document**: `python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <file.docx> <dir>`\n   - **Note the suggested RSID**: The unpack script will suggest an RSID to use for your tracked changes. Copy this RSID for use in step 4b.\n\n4. **Implement changes in batches**: Group changes logically (by section, by type, or by proximity) and implement them together in a single script. This approach:\n   - Makes debugging easier (smaller batch = easier to isolate errors)\n   - Allows incremental progress\n   - Maintains efficiency (batch size of 3-10 changes works well)\n\n   **Suggested batch groupings:**\n   - By document section (e.g., \"Section 3 changes\", \"Definitions\", \"Termination clause\")\n   - By change type (e.g., \"Date changes\", \"Party name updates\", \"Legal term replacements\")\n   - By proximity (e.g., \"Changes on pages 1-3\", \"Changes in first half of document\")\n\n   For each batch of related changes:\n\n   **a. Map text to XML**: Grep for text in `word/document.xml` to verify how text is split across `<w:r>` elements.\n\n   **b. Create and run script**: Use `get_node` to find nodes, implement changes, then `doc.save()`. See **\"Document Library\"** section in ooxml.md for patterns.\n\n   **Note**: Always grep `word/document.xml` immediately before writing a script to get current line numbers and verify text content. Line numbers change after each script run.\n\n5. **Pack the document**: After all batches are complete, convert the unpacked directory back to .docx:\n   ```bash\n   python ooxml/scripts/pack.py unpacked reviewed-document.docx\n   ```\n\n6. **Final verification**: Do a comprehensive check of the complete document:\n   - Convert final document to markdown:\n     ```bash\n     pandoc --track-changes=all reviewed-document.docx -o verification.md\n     ```\n   - Verify ALL changes were applied correctly:\n     ```bash\n     grep \"original phrase\" verification.md  # Should NOT find it\n     grep \"replacement phrase\" verification.md  # Should find it\n     ```\n   - Check that no unintended changes were introduced\n\n\n## Converting Documents to Images\n\nTo visually analyze Word documents, convert them to images using a two-step process:\n\n1. **Convert DOCX to PDF**:\n   ```bash\n   soffice --headless --convert-to pdf document.docx\n   ```\n\n2. **Convert PDF pages to JPEG images**:\n   ```bash\n   pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 document.pdf page\n   ```\n   This creates files like `page-1.jpg`, `page-2.jpg`, etc.\n\nOptions:\n- `-r 150`: Sets resolution to 150 DPI (adjust for quality/size balance)\n- `-jpeg`: Output JPEG format (use `-png` for PNG if preferred)\n- `-f N`: First page to convert (e.g., `-f 2` starts from page 2)\n- `-l N`: Last page to convert (e.g., `-l 5` stops at page 5)\n- `page`: Prefix for output files\n\nExample for specific range:\n```bash\npdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 -f 2 -l 5 document.pdf page  # Converts only pages 2-5\n```\n\n## Code Style Guidelines\n**IMPORTANT**: When generating code for DOCX operations:\n- Write concise code\n- Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations\n- Avoid unnecessary print statements\n\n## Dependencies\n\nRequired dependencies (install if not available):\n\n- **pandoc**: `sudo apt-get install pandoc` (for text extraction)\n- **docx**: `npm install -g docx` (for creating new documents)\n- **LibreOffice**: `sudo apt-get install libreoffice` (for PDF conversion)\n- **Poppler**: `sudo apt-get install poppler-utils` (for pdftoppm to convert PDF to images)\n- **defusedxml**: `pip install defusedxml` (for secure XML parsing)\n</skill>"}]}}

Schema compliance rules and validation requirements\r\n- [Document Content Patterns](#document-content-patterns) - XML patterns for headings, lists, tables, formatting, etc.\r\n- [Document Library (Python)](#document-library-python) - Recommended approach for OOXML manipulation with automatic infrastructure setup\r\n- [Tracked Changes (Redlining)](#tracked-changes-redlining) - XML patterns for implementing tracked changes\r\n\r\n## Technical Guidelines\r\n\r\n### Schema Compliance\r\n- **Element ordering in `<w:pPr>`**: `<w:pStyle>`, `<w:numPr>`, `<w:spacing>`, `<w:ind>`, `<w:jc>`\r\n- **Whitespace**: Add `xml:space='preserve'` to `<w:t>` elements with leading/trailing spaces\r\n- **Unicode**: Escape characters in ASCII content: `\"` becomes `&#8220;`\r\n  - **Character encoding reference**: Curly quotes `\"\"` become `&#8220;&#8221;`, apostrophe `'` becomes `&#8217;`, em-dash `—` becomes `&#8212;`\r\n- **Tracked changes**: Use `<w:del>` and `<w:ins>` tags with `w:author=\"Claude\"` outside `<w:r>` elements\r\n  - **Critical**: `<w:ins>` closes with `</w:ins>`, `<w:del>` closes with `</w:del>` - never mix\r\n  - **RSIDs must be 8-digit hex**: Use values like `00AB1234` (only 0-9, A-F characters)\r\n  - **trackRevisions placement**: Add `<w:trackRevisions/>` after `<w:proofState>` in settings.xml\r\n- **Images**: Add to `word/media/`, reference in `document.xml`, set dimensions to prevent overflow\r\n\r\n## Document Content Patterns\r\n\r\n### Basic Structure\r\n```xml\r\n<w:p>\r\n  <w:r><w:t>Text content</w:t></w:r>\r\n</w:p>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Headings and Styles\r\n```xml\r\n<w:p>\r\n  <w:pPr>\r\n    <w:pStyle w:val=\"Title\"/>\r\n    <w:jc w:val=\"center\"/>\r\n  </w:pPr>\r\n  <w:r><w:t>Document Title</w:t></w:r>\r\n</w:p>\r\n\r\n<w:p>\r\n  <w:pPr><w:pStyle w:val=\"Heading2\"/></w:pPr>\r\n  <w:r><w:t>Section Heading</w:t></w:r>\r\n</w:p>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Text Formatting\r\n```xml\r\n<!-- Bold -->\r\n<w:r><w:rPr><w:b/><w:bCs/></w:rPr><w:t>Bold</w:t></w:r>\r\n<!-- Italic -->\r\n<w:r><w:rPr><w:i/><w:iCs/></w:rPr><w:t>Italic</w:t></w:r>\r\n<!-- Underline -->\r\n<w:r><w:rPr><w:u w:val=\"single\"/></w:rPr><w:t>Underlined</w:t></w:r>\r\n<!-- Highlight -->\r\n<w:r><w:rPr><w:highlight w:val=\"yellow\"/></w:rPr><w:t>Highlighted</w:t></w:r>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Lists\r\n```xml\r\n<!-- Numbered list -->\r\n<w:p>\r\n  <w:pPr>\r\n    <w:pStyle w:val=\"ListParagraph\"/>\r\n    <w:numPr><w:ilvl w:val=\"0\"/><w:numId w:val=\"1\"/></w:numPr>\r\n    <w:spacing w:before=\"240\"/>\r\n  </w:pPr>\r\n  <w:r><w:t>First item</w:t></w:r>\r\n</w:p>\r\n\r\n<!-- Restart numbered list at 1 -

Without this style, links will look like regular text instead of blue underlined clickable links.\r\n\r\n**External Links:**\r\n```xml\r\n<!-- In document.xml -->\r\n<w:hyperlink r:id=\"rId5\">\r\n  <w:r>\r\n    <w:rPr><w:rStyle w:val=\"Hyperlink\"/></w:rPr>\r\n    <w:t>Link Text</w:t>\r\n  </w:r>\r\n</w:hyperlink>\r\n\r\n<!-- In word/_rels/document.xml.rels -->\r\n<Relationship Id=\"rId5\" Type=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/hyperlink\" \r\n              Target=\"https://www.example.com/\" TargetMode=\"External\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Internal Links:**\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<!-- Link to bookmark -->\r\n<w:hyperlink w:anchor=\"myBookmark\">\r\n  <w:r>\r\n    <w:rPr><w:rStyle w:val=\"Hyperlink\"/></w:rPr>\r\n    <w:t>Link Text</w:t>\r\n  </w:r>\r\n</w:hyperlink>\r\n\r\n<!-- Bookmark target -->\r\n<w:bookmarkStart w:id=\"0\" w:name=\"myBookmark\"/>\r\n<w:r><w:t>Target content</w:t></w:r>\r\n<w:bookmarkEnd w:id=\"0\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Hyperlink Style (required in styles.xml):**\r\n```xml\r\n<w:style w:type=\"character\" w:styleId=\"Hyperlink\">\r\n  <w:name w:val=\"Hyperlink\"/>\r\n  <w:basedOn w:val=\"DefaultParagraphFont\"/>\r\n  <w:uiPriority w:val=\"99\"/>\r\n  <w:unhideWhenUsed/>\r\n  <w:rPr>\r\n    <w:color w:val=\"467886\" w:themeColor=\"hyperlink\"/>\r\n    <w:u w:val=\"single\"/>\r\n  </w:rPr>\r\n</w:style>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Document Library (Python)\r\n\r\nUse the Document class from `scripts/document.py` for all tracked changes and comments. It automatically handles infrastructure setup (people.xml, RSIDs, settings.xml, comment files, relationships, content types). Only use direct XML manipulation for complex scenarios not supported by the library.\r\n\r\n**Working with Unicode and Entities:**\r\n- **Searching**: Both entity notation and Unicode characters work - `contains=\"&#8220;Company\"` and `contains=\"\\u201cCompany\"` find the same text\r\n- **Replacing**: Use either entities (`&#8220;`) or Unicode (`\\u201c`) - both work and will be converted appropriately based on the file's encoding (ascii → entities, utf-8 → Unicode)\r\n\r\n### Initialization\r\n\r\n**Find the docx skill root** (directory containing `scripts/` and `ooxml/`):\r\n```bash\r\n# Search for document.py to locate the skill root\r\n# Note: /mnt/skills is used here as an example; check your context for the actual location\r\nfind /mnt/skills -name \"document.py\" -path \"*/docx/scripts/*\" 2>/dev/null | head -1\r\n# Example output: /mnt/skills/docx/scripts/document.py\r\n# Skill root is: /mnt/skills/docx\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Run your script with PYTHONPATH** set to the docx skill root:\r\n```bash\r\nPYTHONPATH=/mnt/skills/docx python your_script.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n**In your script**, import from the skill root:\r\n```python\r\nfrom scripts.document import Document, DocxXMLEditor\r\n\r\n# Basic initialization (automatically creates temp copy and sets up infrastructure)\r\ndoc = Document('unpacked')\r\n\r\n# Customize author and initials\r\ndoc = Document('unpacked', author=\"John Doe\", initials=\"JD\")\r\n\r\n# Enable track revisions mode\r\ndoc = Document('unpacked', track_revisions=True)\r\n\r\n# Specify custom RSID (auto-generated if not provided)\r\ndoc = Document('unpacked', rsid=\"07DC5ECB\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Creating Tracked Changes\r\n\r\n**CRITICAL**: Only mark text that actually changes. Keep ALL unchanged text outside `<w:del>`/`<w:ins>` tags. Marking unchanged text makes edits unprofessional and harder to review.\r\n\r\n**Attribute Handling**: The Document class auto-injects attributes (w:id, w:date, w:rsidR, w:rsidDel, w16du:dateUtc, xml:space) into new elements. When preserving unchanged text from the original document, copy the original `<w:r>` element with its existing attributes to maintain document integrity.\r\n\r\n**Method Selection Guide**:\r\n- **Adding your own changes to regular text**: Use `replace_node()` with `<w:del>`/`<w:ins>` tags, or `suggest_deletion()` for removing entire `<w:r>` or `<w:p>` elements\r\n- **Partially modifying another author's tracked change**: Use `replace_node()` to nest your changes inside their `<w:ins>`/`<w:del>`\r\n- **Completely rejecting another author's insertion**: Use `revert_insertion()` on the `<w:ins>` element (NOT `suggest_deletion()`)\r\n- **Completely rejecting another author's deletion**: Use `revert_deletion()` on the `<w:del>` element to restore deleted content using tracked changes\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Minimal edit - change one word: \"The report is monthly\" → \"The report is quarterly\"\r\n# Original: <w:r w:rsidR=\"00AB12CD\"><w:rPr><w:rFonts w:ascii=\"Calibri\"/></w:rPr><w:t>The report is monthly</w:t></w:r>\r\nnode = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:r\", contains=\"The report is monthly\")\r\nrpr = tags[0].toxml() if (tags := node.getElementsByTagName(\"w:rPr\")) else \"\"\r\nreplacement = f'<w:r w:rsidR=\"00AB12CD\">{rpr}<w:t>The report is </w:t></w:r><w:del><w:r>{rpr}<w:delText>monthly</w:delText></w:r></w:del><w:ins><w:r>{rpr}<w:t>quarterly</w:t></w:r></w:ins>'\r\ndoc[\"word/document.xml\"].replace_node(node, replacement)\r\n\r\n# Minimal edit - change number: \"within 30 days\" → \"within 45 days\"\r\n# Original: <w:r w:rsidR=\"00XYZ789\"><w:rPr><w:rFonts w:ascii=\"Calibri\"/></w:rPr><w:t>within 30 days</w:t></w:r>\r\nnode = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:r\", contains=\"within 30 days\")\r\nrpr = tags[0].toxml() if (tags := node.getElementsByTagName(\"w:rPr\")) else \"\"\r\nreplacement = f'<w:r w:rsidR=\"00XYZ789\">{rpr}<w:t>within </w:t></w:r><w:del><w:r>{rpr}<w:delText>30</w:delText></w:r></w:del><w:ins><w:r>{rpr}<w:t>45</w:t></w:r></w:ins><w:r w:rsidR=\"00XYZ789\">{rpr}<w:t> days</w:t></w:r>'\r\ndoc[\"word/document.xml\"].replace_node(node, replacement)\r\n\r\n# Complete replacement - preserve formatting even when replacing all text\r\nnode = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:r\", contains=\"apple\")\r\nrpr = tags[0].toxml() if (tags := node.getElementsByTagName(\"w:rPr\")) else \"\"\r\nreplacement = f'<w:del><w:r>{rpr}<w:delText>apple</w:delText></w:r></w:del><w:ins><w:r>{rpr}<w:t>banana orange</w:t></w:r></w:ins>'\r\ndoc[\"word/document.xml\"].replace_node(node, replacement)\r\n\r\n# Insert new content (no attributes needed - auto-injected)\r\nnode = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:r\", contains=\"existing text\")\r\ndoc[\"word/document.xml\"].insert_after(node, '<w:ins><w:r><w:t>new text</w:t></w:r></w:ins>')\r\n\r\n# Partially delete another author's insertion\r\n# Original: <w:ins w:author=\"Jane Smith\" w:date=\"...\"><w:r><w:t>quarterly financial report</w:t></w:r></w:ins>\r\n# Goal: Delete only \"financial\" to make it \"quarterly report\"\r\nnode = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:ins\", attrs={\"w:id\": \"5\"})\r\n# IMPORTANT: Preserve w:author=\"Jane Smith\" on the outer <w:ins> to maintain authorship\r\nreplacement = '''<w:ins w:author=\"Jane Smith\" w:date=\"2025-01-15T10:00:00Z\">\r\n  <w:r><w:t>quarterly </w:t></w:r>\r\n  <w:del><w:r><w:delText>financial </w:delText></w:r></w:del>\r\n  <w:r><w:t>report</w:t></w:r>\r\n</w:ins>'''\r\ndoc[\"word/document.xml\"].replace_node(node, replacement)\r\n\r\n# Change part of another author's insertion\r\n# Original: <w:ins w:author=\"Jane Smith\"><w:r><w:t>in silence, safe and sound</w:t></w:r></w:ins>\r\n# Goal: Change \"safe and sound\" to \"soft and unbound\"\r\nnode = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:ins\", attrs={\"w:id\": \"8\"})\r\nreplacement = f'''<w:ins w:author=\"Jane Smith\" w:date=\"2025-01-15T10:00:00Z\">\r\n  <w:r><w:t>in silence, </w:t></w:r>\r\n</w:ins>\r\n<w:ins>\r\n  <w:r><w:t>soft and unbound</w:t></w:r>\r\n</w:ins>\r\n<w:ins w:author=\"Jane Smith\" w:date=\"2025-01-15T10:00:00Z\">\r\n  <w:del><w:r><w:delText>safe and sound</w:delText></w:r></w:del>\r\n</w:ins>'''\r\ndoc[\"word/document.xml\"].replace_node(node, replacement)\r\n\r\n# Delete entire run (use only when deleting all content;

Only search by w:id if you know it from XML inspection\r\nstart_node = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:del\", attrs={\"w:id\": \"1\"})\r\nend_node = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:ins\", attrs={\"w:id\": \"2\"})\r\ndoc.add_comment(start=start_node, end=end_node, text=\"Explanation of this change\")\r\n\r\n# Add comment on a paragraph\r\npara = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:p\", contains=\"paragraph text\")\r\ndoc.add_comment(start=para, end=para, text=\"Comment on this paragraph\")\r\n\r\n# Add comment on newly created tracked change\r\n# First create the tracked change\r\nnode = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:r\", contains=\"old\")\r\nnew_nodes = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].replace_node(\r\n    node,\r\n    '<w:del><w:r><w:delText>old</w:delText></w:r></w:del><w:ins><w:r><w:t>new</w:t></w:r></w:ins>'\r\n)\r\n# Then add comment on the newly created elements\r\n# new_nodes[0] is the <w:del>, new_nodes[1] is the <w:ins>\r\ndoc.add_comment(start=new_nodes[0], end=new_nodes[1], text=\"Changed old to new per requirements\")\r\n\r\n# Reply to existing comment\r\ndoc.reply_to_comment(parent_comment_id=0, text=\"I agree with this change\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Rejecting Tracked Changes\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT**: Use `revert_insertion()` to reject insertions and `revert_deletion()` to restore deletions using tracked changes. Use `suggest_deletion()` only for regular unmarked content.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Reject insertion (wraps it in deletion)\r\n# Use this when another author inserted text that you want to delete\r\nins = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:ins\", attrs={\"w:id\": \"5\"})\r\nnodes = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].revert_insertion(ins)  # Returns [ins]\r\n\r\n# Reject deletion (creates insertion to restore deleted content)\r\n# Use this when another author deleted text that you want to restore\r\ndel_elem = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:del\", attrs={\"w:id\": \"3\"})\r\nnodes = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].revert_deletion(del_elem)  # Returns [del_elem, new_ins]\r\n\r\n# Reject all insertions in a paragraph\r\npara = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:p\", contains=\"paragraph text\")\r\nnodes = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].revert_insertion(para)  # Returns [para]\r\n\r\n# Reject all deletions in a paragraph\r\npara = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:p\", contains=\"paragraph text\")\r\nnodes = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].revert_deletion(para)  # Returns [para]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Inserting Images\r\n\r\n**CRITICAL**: The Document class works with a temporary copy at `doc.unpacked_path`. Always copy images to this temp directory, not the original unpacked folder.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom PIL import Image\r\nimport shutil, os\r\n\r\n# Initialize document first\r\ndoc = Document('unpacked')\r\n\r\n# Copy image and calculate full-width dimensions with aspect ratio\r\nmedia_dir = os.path.join(doc.unpacked_path, 'word/media')\r\nos.makedirs(media_dir, exist_ok=True)\r\nshutil.copy('image.png', os.path.join(media_dir, 'image1.png'))\r\nimg = Image.open(os.path.join(media_dir, 'image1.png'))\r\nwidth_emus = int(6.5 * 914400)  # 6.5\" usable width, 914400 EMUs/inch\r\nheight_emus = int(width_emus * img.size[1] / img.size[0])\r\n\r\n# Add relationship and content type\r\nrels_editor = doc['word/_rels/document.xml.rels']\r\nnext_rid = rels_editor.get_next_rid()\r\nrels_editor.append_to(rels_editor.dom.documentElement,\r\n    f'<Relationship Id=\"{next_rid}\" Type=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/image\" Target=\"media/image1.png\"/>')\r\ndoc['[Content_Types].xml'].append_to(doc['[Content_Types].xml'].dom.documentElement,\r\n    '<Default Extension=\"png\" ContentType=\"image/png\"/>')\r\n\r\n# Insert image\r\nnode = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:p\", line_number=100)\r\ndoc[\"word/document.xml\"].insert_after(node, f'''<w:p>\r\n  <w:r>\r\n    <w:drawing>\r\n      <wp:inline distT=\"0\" distB=\"0\" distL=\"0\" distR=\"0\">\r\n        <wp:extent cx=\"{width_emus}\" cy=\"{height_emus}\"/>\r\n        <wp:docPr id=\"1\" name=\"Picture 1\"/>\r\n        <a:graphic xmlns:a=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/main\">\r\n          <a:graphicData uri=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/picture\">\r\n            <pic:pic xmlns:pic=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/picture\">\r\n              <pic:nvPicPr><pic:cNvPr id=\"1\" name=\"image1.png\"/><pic:cNvPicPr/></pic:nvPicPr>\r\n              <pic:blipFill><a:blip r:embed=\"{next_rid}\"/><a:stretch><a:fillRect/></a:stretch></pic:blipFill>\r\n              <pic:spPr><a:xfrm><a:ext cx=\"{width_emus}\" cy=\"{height_emus}\"/></a:xfrm><a:prstGeom prst=\"rect\"><a:avLst/></a:prstGeom></pic:spPr>\r\n            </pic:pic>\r\n          </a:graphicData>\r\n        </a:graphic>\r\n      </wp:inline>\r\n    </w:drawing>\r\n  </w:r>\r\n</w:p>''')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Getting Nodes\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# By text content\r\nnode = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:p\", contains=\"specific text\")\r\n\r\n# By line range\r\npara = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:p\", line_number=range(100, 150))\r\n\r\n# By attributes\r\nnode = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:del\", attrs={\"w:id\": \"1\"})\r\n\r\n# By exact line number (must be line number where tag opens)\r\npara = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:p\", line_number=42)\r\n\r\n# Combine filters\r\nnode = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:r\", line_number=range(40, 60), contains=\"text\")\r\n\r\n# Disambiguate when text appears multiple times - add line_number range\r\nnode = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:r\", contains=\"Section\", line_number=range(2400, 2500))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Saving\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Save with automatic validation (copies back to original directory)\r\ndoc.save()  # Validates by default, raises error if validation fails\r\n\r\n# Save to different location\r\ndoc.save('modified-unpacked')\r\n\r\n# Skip validation (debugging only - needing this in production indicates XML issues)\r\ndoc.save(validate=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Direct DOM Manipulation\r\n\r\nFor complex scenarios not covered by the library:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Access any XML file\r\neditor = doc[\"word/document.xml\"]\r\neditor = doc[\"word/comments.xml\"]\r\n\r\n# Direct DOM access (defusedxml.minidom.Document)\r\nnode = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:p\", line_number=5)\r\nparent = node.parentNode\r\nparent.removeChild(node)\r\nparent.appendChild(node)  # Move to end\r\n\r\n# General document manipulation (without tracked changes)\r\nold_node = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:p\", contains=\"original text\")\r\ndoc[\"word/document.xml\"].replace_node(old_node, \"<w:p><w:r><w:t>replacement text</w:t></w:r></w:p>\")\r\n\r\n# Multiple insertions - use return value to maintain order\r\nnode = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].get_node(tag=\"w:r\", line_number=100)\r\nnodes = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].insert_after(node, \"<w:r><w:t>A</w:t></w:r>\")\r\nnodes = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].insert_after(nodes[-1], \"<w:r><w:t>B</w:t></w:r>\")\r\nnodes = doc[\"word/document.xml\"].insert_after(nodes[-1], \"<w:r><w:t>C</w:t></w:r>\")\r\n# Results in: original_node, A, B, C\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tracked Changes (Redlining)\r\n\r\n**Use the Document class above for all tracked changes.** The patterns below are for reference when constructing replacement XML strings.\r\n\r\n### Validation Rules\r\nThe validator checks that the document text matches the original after reverting Claude's changes. This means:\r\n- **NEVER modify text inside another author's `<w:ins>` or `<w:del>` tags**\r\n- **ALWAYS use nested deletions** to remove another author's insertions\r\n- **Every edit must be properly tracked** with `<w:ins>` or `<w:del>` tags\r\n\r\n### Tracked Change Patterns\r\n\r\n**CRITICAL RULES**:\r\n1. Never modify the content inside another author's tracked changes. Always use nested deletions.\r\n2. **XML Structure**: Always place `<w:del>` and `<w:ins>` at paragraph level containing complete `<w:r>` elements. Never nest inside `<w:r>` elements - this creates invalid XML that breaks document processing.\r\n\r\n**Text Insertion:**\r\n```xml\r\n<w:ins w:id=\"1\" w:author=\"Claude\" w:date=\"2025-07-30T23:05:00Z\" w16du:dateUtc=\"2025-07-31T06:05:00Z\">\r\n  <w:r w:rsidR=\"00792858\">\r\n    <w:t>inserted text</w:t>\r\n  </w:r>\r\n</w:ins>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Text Deletion:**\r\n```xml\r\n<w:del w:id=\"2\" w:author=\"Claude\" w:date=\"2025-07-30T23:05:00Z\" w16du:dateUtc=\"2025-07-31T06:05:00Z\">\r\n  <w:r w:rsidDel=\"00792858\">\r\n    <w:delText>deleted text</w:delText>\r\n  </w:r>\r\n</w:del>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Deleting Another Author's Insertion (MUST use nested structure):**\r\n```xml\r\n<!-- Nest deletion inside the original insertion -->\r\n<w:ins w:author=\"Jane Smith\" w:id=\"16\">\r\n  <w:del w:author=\"Claude\" w:id=\"40\">\r\n    <w:r><w:delText>monthly</w:delText></w:r>\r\n  </w:del>\r\n</w:ins>\r\n<w:ins w:author=\"Claude\" w:id=\"41\">\r\n  <w:r><w:t>weekly</w:t></w:r>\r\n</w:ins>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Restoring Another Author's Deletion:**\r\n```xml\r\n<!-- Leave their deletion unchanged, add new insertion after it -->\r\n<w:del w:author=\"Jane Smith\" w:id=\"50\">\r\n  <w:r><w:delText>within 30 days</w:delText></w:r>\r\n</w:del>\r\n<w:ins w:author=\"Claude\" w:id=\"51\">\r\n  <w:r><w:t>within 30 days</w:t></w:r>\r\n</w:ins>\r\n```"}}
