(file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/video-downloader/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"d75431f7d49fcc78d64a2b83266033fad3b7485d","branch":"main","repository_url":"https://github.com/prof-ramos/Analista.git"}}}
