(file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/video-downloader/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai"}}

It seems compaudit is invoked internally by `compinit`, not just by Oh My Zsh's compfix. I'm considering how `compinit -C` can bypass compaudit by skipping security checks, and exploring how to configure Oh My Zsh to use that option or customize `ZSH_COMPDUMP` to avoid unnecessary compaudit calls. I'll check how Oh My Zsh calls `compinit` in its script to see what can be overridden."}],"content":null,"encrypted_content":"gAAAAABpVrKfsy3_zATg6CmBhH9Z-bKe6pVzlmbb3SHoSTH7duHdJWXVhCHOkWu8bIJjw7BfYf8WmX_MnKzCVWfsQ1c3hp9v1wGCLYwExc-PySL6Uw4dzTyWMgHsKaHqM9rO53jsyM2_Tdsb8fyN6K65g5G6BN3lNZPDTjHya5M--j6Ij2JkZeVdEE9N1NJhE31q-5fewR3tqMgCl6MN1nkRongfLDw7M8jgtSzyakHBAWf9ZrnnPcnVykRwfR_ou-6N7pEipCCutj6SF-kGf7nz_ESqnSU5HXQ895L8AcSomt0BfTf7Q0kGfVcrjEkYt_LCd3rFFggllb2O7ZKURFJ3_kWyq-nn8uJQ9z_AU3aIiApf5IMPFCRKmPBOm6ZMskdAiHa_G_RjiRpNz1blMIoBPZ9hqMkhrxvJ9ysxstxGlSNh6Bqmks76LsE_cerfIuJZhOzRzx3uCWGo0mq7sKpWDXvkldIoyZyvrgIkrCYGtpDqyD1qCqRgNvQHVqgwj3OrUSaWI8RqIQmb51G4nnjM4mhSoeWU_JWn7z0ZxIAMD4Ri92YJPVw1V-sKK6RotXkLVa3klBnDJXQUdrLsmmE92qMF_V5Zalgr4xt_b7yyubtL3Xje_SYLE3TdHuVE0nYLvSn1Z5494MP9fNa6TpZGt771JWkFU7TOkyOqszzBUaCf2S8VazyooBjCWINFfi_3kNW4Wvk3zWxtX56S4yWxesw5bB0G0fYlQtCAdlbkpUuyqvXk_lVWeyjUbc59a0leykmP-GJn19XXroTxP8Y6tl4mHLXGgtBbxnStdVj6_pI50Xkp1ws1E5HT-lz87CBjn_Y-xtO4Qjq-LxIolUec5J3d3hJNaeGlzBZDrQu9Tce5DtFuQo4vhVqUmvy2tKZadsHyVI-5tZYnVrY4ypXPywerkb_2R8XWAax8ICFFRsfmz1WW_yWuqUi_yEV7TrrZvO1SdCeSBYy9eGWbG4Rp4EIcYV8g8VUKrtGGVB0zthupu3R-XPhrCxj_EHkahTlSX8Esv-09MLlk_le9fFBAzwzQ04GPHkGQmSWN__W7gBdZh8qbPgEo5KiQ4EkOeQMnfe2Y1JdcRwxxhsNe0-8IfeCL0wknYOsH2GI-iwgXsGy2IjiAmcPBVR2IF6pTFz21hbdzEefBHTvOJN7y5lVWUCTYJZTwI9MvL0IIHS2mKZjGkjec7IHwuLLNCtJLwD-spIGCQv4Vai7K7n4b2DKmsA4e1qR40w7Bxq8pnAeAcqeVunMdSz-EY92UYNz5YxRp16094xLng8LzytoM5MYqwsmD742U4jP1Z12HNm6ijtQ4p06pTQvi12HZ2l4EYV3bNvZ46B86bWX3Y2leg48eF4P_U0nQkf1AntT6M4fL9qXfmmTLwhowt_ygJabePK4ifp2_ty5DkmrKiEJXYzr_VSXOIAFv0PIj39JHXkTAVFYXpH0oBqjS-MxgO3AFK4DV6_qDTH6O3G7k4tCPhKEHHYAURwFZeP3CE8PO247kYFXRSyl2MiZzKMylrX44ffXolpvYGRKhxSxPbzp6vij-3HUA7w5mFIfxCXrpdKMRmDlnVZIBGRFS7aD4O8zrE8rKRsmcOK82coAAK22SOZtIeU87r_62YVL_3N_ux6Zxmy-3fw5G4Py7gzaIIWlvrnAGr_lJQ9T5HegKpk-7LlwkOOj03M8z4ZfsudOUtn_kuJeCUMmadu06ldIU0k9u7jXOhbyazotGDduxU2qYSG-U9_hwYmcaqB9_Px8eKPMSIsvg7p0H0q-yAus5MMJmBcJsM62ZT8Mpk8LdGXBVfPUnJ0TKjY_ZKOIIum_wsELNNCRKlqcCBfbvkbqdHJjAcI5Q2VXebaWorfzyt7zFCd_7Z9AP3oaLpiLxXhIl9F47Au1_D_-TgmbEPZ3mjR2A5Pt80Y2ukkBC_oE-C9PRm2HYVVamxKV2x0PoewtF2f5qOBcMgh__JI9OEO8WPIpfmaWJ3p8Jfx3yMYzI0Vt-AKQC_sO6CCEHum8ekR8oGpOHbtc19spyT-US_tP6IZPCPOddhfaJZ8NNZC3NBkWp5NA_5uJM9fCa4evrRUCM7nN6sincs586H7ws-_N8q_9UR3mcLZStGVIl3yZntB9bpuOTbVGcCWHfBkAclZAT9uQ7S0bibNgEz6dI17M3sYK_cNTvussXXZodNL_e8J8kapMm6yQu9L10Hhr3Yzj7qmZTPb0ehpu8L7JPBydogN3yILPWY3vcQHaaWL_SuDGg1Ka0Rl-FbkWnzRnMGYqwFYPHEcMOjph56-T-MSnb-4-VVqQFnAEdgZF3IShC3BKinTHoT7tY9j6pUiYIcjPH1ZM0yQNmKFPIHoFZ3a5kTQBldGHmCNOd5Zeff8iRbcgnPxrlgQHoIUyUWQOFtcjqEqzb_4ZtiIQDtLr7mFlVcxJeakyonwddGYdenLz2xNSr-QV89GziV_gabGgqh_LK9pU13rifS0aZWziZ5bGcIq545o_WPnMG8OvWNczA6byyITmroHczqNghK-Vet56D_Owmpud7kkc_Y8lcehTvDfz-SZJeyYyECr9fUV5kjruLiV-gmJGMhro2neR67d5hS_ubIVSGRsgGt46syCD9v3FtacAgaftmxzmBMcMPBNvzrG_KtITC-VYll4Jc7vwrMK4wC2MTDMX3ye7ns1XIQNg8pPzoT0dTm9IVll7VeHkvOxFxa3anNSHlExZ1c17GH9_mk10ObBh-BxTDp-wDsEH0YK1euovOLP7fGsUN1QcvjHzpIwj7l0zzTWPW7aztVWrs-iUodvborKlWmatwHJGAtrrbACWr2oQ5Q4SLgHdlztto4MUp87NU7XekGPk2Dw3LUSNvyCAHQsFDDDqYWXHEL_sva9nfkBWC9G0zAYHkWS-wHqai4e7f8tLnKMS1x1QfQaD5DKpJvFlvvpDjf-YwT3w3N2y2IIwwNT6Nj4-fUx1hxgC5tluJjTb5Ah9UHlxnnE6T8Mz2VDv67VfJBw_a9oxOzsY2EgV3MdsE0ijK20hF0Rkz2jqDtdXDakgi6Sp4A1Kjw9cLGjUOjYLVLWDIY8vNMs2OM8Vn_lFacW7b7zg4UeC5g4az6UgTp30sG6YnCP-PuRO1i6o--a1zVSN0w-mQ3TQ2oPO_q8YfINg6QvPZZRDtuNf2PgNMTAalZwELXginmxHy-snfUSvukd1E9TA5_imU6sBGGR6na2saUzoDUlw3YOyCvQ=="}}
