Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"ff52505b71f3e6726982828b325d0ec16f66a0e8","branch":"main","repository_url":"https://github.com/prof-ramos/ponto-salinha.git"}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

By default these are from https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated, but users can also provide other locations.\n\nUse the helper scripts based on the task:\n- List curated skills when the user asks what is available, or if the user uses this skill without specifying what to do.\n- Install from the curated list when the user provides a skill name.\n- Install from another repo when the user provides a GitHub repo/path (including private repos).\n\nInstall skills with the helper scripts.\n\n## Communication\n\nWhen listing curated skills, output approximately as follows, depending on the context of the user's request:\n\"\"\"\nSkills from {repo}:\n1. skill-1\n2. skill-2 (already installed)\n3. ...\nWhich ones would you like installed?\n\"\"\"\n\nAfter installing a skill, tell the user: \"Restart Codex to pick up new skills.\"\n\n## Scripts\n\nAll of these scripts use network, so when running in the sandbox, request escalation when running them.\n\n- `scripts/list-curated-skills.py` (prints curated list with installed annotations)\n- `scripts/list-curated-skills.py --format json`\n- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --repo <owner>/<repo> --path <path/to/skill> [<path/to/skill> ...]`\n- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --url https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<ref>/<path>`\n\n## Behavior and Options\n\n- Defaults to direct download for public GitHub repos.\n- If download fails with auth/permission errors, falls back to git sparse checkout.\n- Aborts if the destination skill directory already exists.\n- Installs into `$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill-name>` (defaults to `~/.codex/skills`).\n- Multiple `--path` values install multiple skills in one run, each named from the path basename unless `--name` is supplied.\n- Options: `--ref <ref>` (default `main`), `--dest <path>`, `--method auto|download|git`.\n\n## Notes\n\n- Curated listing is fetched from `https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated` via the GitHub API. If it is unavailable, explain the error and exit.\n- Private GitHub repos can be accessed via existing git credentials or optional `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` for download.\n- Git fallback tries HTTPS first, then SSH.\n- The skills at https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.system are preinstalled, so no need to help users install those. If they ask, just explain this. If they insist, you can download and overwrite.\n- Installed annotations come from `$CODEX_HOME/skills`.\n\n</skill>"}]}}
