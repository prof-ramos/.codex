Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"39a52e135c67e8647b8756ca814b779a0e3ed506","branch":"main","repository_url":"https://github.com/prof-ramos/telegram-manager-lab.git"}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Use at the start of every Claude Code session when the user provides their first prompt, and whenever the user switches to a distinctly new high-level task. Helps developers manage multiple Claude Code terminals by providing clear, at-a-glance identification of what each terminal is working on.\r\nmin_claude_code_version: \"1.0.0\"\r\nversion: \"1.1.0\"\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Terminal Title\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nAutomatically sets descriptive terminal window titles based on the task Claude is working on. Essential for developers running multiple Claude Code instances who need to quickly identify which terminal is handling which task.\r\n\r\n## When to Use\r\n\r\n**Always trigger this skill:**\r\n- At the start of every new Claude Code session (after receiving the first user prompt)\r\n- When switching to a substantially different task (e.g., from \"API Integration\" to \"Database Migration\")\r\n\r\n**Trigger on task switches like these:**\r\n- Switching from frontend work to backend work\r\n- Moving from debugging to new feature development\r\n- Changing from one module/component to a completely different one\r\n- Starting work on a different part of the system (e.g., from auth to payments)\r\n\r\n**Do NOT trigger for:**\r\n- Follow-up questions about the same task (\"Can you add a comment to that function?\")\r\n- Small refinements to current work (\"Make it blue instead of red\")\r\n- Debugging the same feature you just built\r\n- Clarifications (\"What did you mean by X?\")\r\n- Iterating on the same component or module\r\n- Mid-task status updates or progress checks\r\n\r\n## How It Works\r\n\r\n1. **Extract Task Summary**: Analyze the user's prompt to identify the high-level task\r\n2. **Generate Title**: Create a concise, descriptive title (max 40 characters)\r\n3. **Set Title**: Execute the `scripts/set_title.sh` script with the generated title\r\n4. **No Confirmation Needed**: This happens automatically in the background\r\n\r\n## Title Format Guidelines\r\n\r\n**Good titles:**\r\n- \"API Integration: Auth Flow\"\r\n- \"Fix: Login Bug\"\r\n- \"DB Migration: Users Table\"\r\n- \"Build: Dashboard UI\"\r\n- \"Refactor: Payment Module\"\r\n\r\n**Bad titles:**\r\n- Too long: \"Implementing the new authentication system with OAuth2.0 support\" (exceeds 40 chars)\r\n- Too generic: \"Working\" or \"Coding\"\r\n- Too verbose: \"The user wants me to help them with...\"\r\n\r\n**Format pattern:**\r\n```\r\n[Action/Category]: [Specific Focus]\r\n```\r\n\r\nKeep titles concise, actionable, and immediately recognizable.\r\n\r\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\r\n\r\n**❌ Too Verbose:**\r\n- Bad: \"Working on implementing the user authentication system with JWT tokens\"\r\n- Good: \"Build: JWT Auth\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Too Vague:**\r\n- Bad: \"Code stuff\"\r\n- Bad: \"Working\"\r\n- Good: \"Refactor: API Layer\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Including System Information:**\r\n- Bad: \"john-macbook-pro: Debug app\"\r\n- Bad: \"/Users/john/project: Build feature\"\r\n- Good: \"Debug: App Issues\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Using Complete Sentences:**\r\n- Bad: \"I am working on the dashboard component\"\r\n- Good: \"Build: Dashboard UI\"\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n**Execute the title script:**\r\n```bash\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Your Title Here\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# User asks: \"Help me debug the authentication flow in the API\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Debug: Auth API Flow\"\r\n\r\n# User asks: \"Create a React component for the user profile page\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Build: User Profile UI\"\r\n\r\n# User asks: \"Write tests for the payment processing module\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Test: Payment Module\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Script Details\r\n\r\nThe `scripts/set_title.sh` script uses ANSI escape sequences to set the terminal title. It's compatible with:\r\n- macOS Terminal\r\n- iTerm2\r\n- Alacritty\r\n- Most modern terminal emulators (xterm, rxvt, screen, tmux)\r\n\r\nThe script accepts a single argument (the title string) and exits silently if no title is provided (fail-safe behavior).\r\n\r\n## Optional Customization\r\n\r\nUsers can optionally customize terminal titles with a prefix by setting the `CLAUDE_TITLE_PREFIX` environment variable:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport CLAUDE_TITLE_PREFIX=\"🤖 Claude\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis produces titles like: `🤖 Claude | Build: Dashboard UI`\r\n\r\nWithout the prefix, titles remain in the standard format: `Build: Dashboard UI`\r\n\r\n**Note:** You don't need to check for this variable or modify your behavior. The script handles this automatically.\r\n"}}

Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.\r\n\r\n## The Process\r\n\r\n**Understanding the idea:**\r\n- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)\r\n- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea\r\n- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too\r\n- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions\r\n- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria\r\n\r\n**Exploring approaches:**\r\n- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs\r\n- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning\r\n- Lead with your recommended option and explain why\r\n\r\n**Presenting the design:**\r\n- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design\r\n- Break it into sections of 200-300 words\r\n- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far\r\n- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing\r\n- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense\r\n\r\n## After the Design\r\n\r\n**Documentation:**\r\n- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`\r\n- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available\r\n- Commit the design document to git\r\n\r\n**Implementation (if continuing):**\r\n- Ask: \"Ready to set up for implementation?\"\r\n- Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create isolated workspace\r\n- Use superpowers:writing-plans to create detailed implementation plan\r\n\r\n## Key Principles\r\n\r\n- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions\r\n- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible\r\n- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs\r\n- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling\r\n- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each\r\n- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense\r\n"}}

Ele resolve o problema de gerenciar e extrair dados de centenas de conversas manualmente.\r\n\r\nFocado em performance e experiência do usuário, o projeto utiliza a biblioteca `Rich` para oferecer uma interface moderna com tema **Synthwave/Cyberpunk**, tornando a visualização de logs e estatísticas uma experiência agradável.\r\n\r\n### ✨ Principais Funcionalidades\r\n\r\n- 🔍 **Scanner Inteligente**: Varre automaticamente todas as suas conversas (Chats privados, Grupos, Canais e Bots).\r\n- 📊 **Classificação Automática**: Separa e contabiliza cada tipo de diálogo.\r\n- 💾 **Exportação Multi-formato**: Gera relatórios detalhados em **JSON** e **CSV** para análise de dados.\r\n- 🎨 **Interface Rica**: Feedback visual em tempo real com barras de progresso e tabelas formatadas.\r\n- ⚡ **Assíncrono**: Construído sobre `asyncio` e `Telethon` para máxima performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📑 Índice\r\n\r\n- [Instalação](#-instalação)\r\n- [Configuração](#-configuração)\r\n- [Como Usar](#-como-usar)\r\n- [Estrutura do Projeto](#-estrutura-do-projeto)\r\n- [Desenvolvimento](#-desenvolvimento)\r\n- [Testes](#-testes)\r\n- [Roadmap](#-roadmap)\r\n- [Contribuindo](#-contribuindo)\r\n- [Licença](#-licença)\r\n- [Autor](#-autor)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🚀 Instalação\r\n\r\n### Pré-requisitos\r\n\r\n- **Python 3.8** ou superior.\r\n- Uma conta ativa no Telegram.\r\n- Credenciais da API do Telegram (`API_ID` e `API_HASH`). Você pode obtê-las gratuitamente em [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/apps).\r\n\r\n### Passo a Passo\r\n\r\nRecomendamos o uso do gerenciador de pacotes `uv` para uma experiência mais rápida e segura, mas o `pip` padrão também é suportado.\r\n\r\n#### Opção A: Usando `uv` (Recomendado)\r\n\r\n1. **Clone o repositório:**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   git clone https://github.com/gabrielramos/telegram-manager-lab.git\r\n   cd telegram-manager-lab\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Instale as dependências e o ambiente virtual:**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   uv sync\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n#### Opção B: Usando `pip`\r\n\r\n1. **Clone o repositório:**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   git clone https://github.com/gabrielramos/telegram-manager-lab.git\r\n   cd telegram-manager-lab\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Crie e ative um ambiente virtual:**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   python -m venv venv\r\n   # Linux/macOS\r\n"}}

Documentation and setup info live in `README.md` and `DEVELOPMENT.md`. Tests (when added) should go under `tests/`.\r\n\r\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\r\n- `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`: create/activate a virtualenv.\r\n- `pip install -r requirements.txt`: install runtime dependencies.\r\n- `pip install -e .[dev]`: install dev tooling (pytest, black, flake8, mypy, isort).\r\n- `python main.py`: run the CLI scanner/exporter locally.\r\n- `python -m build`: build a package distribution.\r\n- `rm -rf venv .venv build dist *.egg-info __pycache__ .pytest_cache`: clean virtualenv and build caches.\r\n\r\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\r\n- Python 3.8+, 4-space indentation, type hints expected across new code.\r\n- Docstrings follow Google style; keep functions focused and well-logged.\r\n- Format with `black telegram_manager/` and sort imports with `isort telegram_manager/`.\r\n- Lint with `flake8 telegram_manager/ --max-line-length=100` and type-check with `mypy telegram_manager/`.\r\n- When `mypy` or `flake8` fail, fix the underlying issue; use `# type: ignore` only as a last resort with an inline justification comment and a TODO/ticket reference, and get reviewer approval for new ignores.\r\n\r\n## Testing Guidelines & Coverage\r\n- Framework: `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio`.\r\n- Run tests with `pytest` or coverage via `pytest --cov=telegram_manager --cov-report=html`.\r\n- Naming: `tests/<module>/test_<feature>.py` with `test_`-prefixed functions.\r\n- Fixtures: define shared fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`; use function vs module scope intentionally and `pytest-asyncio` for `async def` fixtures.\r\n- Coverage Expectation: aim for 80%+ coverage on critical modules (scanner, exporter, config).\r\n\r\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\r\n- Git history currently only shows `initial commit`; no enforced convention yet.\r\n- Follow Conventional Commits from `DEVELOPMENT.md`: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:` and scoped forms like `feat(scanner): ...`.\r\n- PRs should include a concise summary, test results, and any CLI output screenshots if behavior changes.\r\n\r\n## Security & Configuration Tips\r\n- Use `.env` for `TELEGRAM_API_ID`, `TELEGRAM_API_HASH`, and `TELEGRAM_PHONE`.\r\n- Ensure `.gitignore` includes `.env` (sample entry: `.env`); update `.env.example` when adding new settings.\r\n- During first login, enter the Telegram-provided code or an authenticator app code if 2FA is enabled.\r\n- Be mindful of Telegram rate limits (FloodWait) and 2FA prompts.\r\n"}}

It features a distinct **Synthwave/Cyberpunk** aesthetic powered by the `rich` library and leverages `Telethon` for robust, asynchronous interaction with the Telegram API.\r\n\r\n## Project Overview\r\n\r\n*   **Goal:** Automate the extraction and classification of Telegram dialogs (Users, Bots, Groups, Channels) and export data for analysis.\r\n*   **Architecture:** Modular design with clear separation of concerns:\r\n    *   `core/`: Business logic (Client management, Scanning, Exporting).\r\n    *   `ui/`: Presentation layer (TUI components, Themes).\r\n    *   `utils/`: Configuration and helper functions.\r\n*   **Key Features:**\r\n    *   Asynchronous scanning of all dialogs.\r\n    *   Automatic classification of entity types.\r\n    *   Data export to JSON and CSV.\r\n    *   Visual feedback with progress bars and formatted tables.\r\n\r\n## Building and Running\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n*   Python 3.8+\r\n*   Telegram API Credentials (`API_ID`, `API_HASH`) from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/apps).\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\n1.  **Configure Environment:**\r\n    Copy the example configuration and fill in your credentials:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    cp .env.example .env\r\n    # Edit .env with your TELEGRAM_API_ID, TELEGRAM_API_HASH, and TELEGRAM_PHONE\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2.  **Install Dependencies:**\r\n    Using `uv` (Recommended):\r\n    ```bash\r\n    uv sync\r\n    ```\r\n    Using `pip`:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Execution\r\n\r\nTo run the main application:\r\n```bash\r\n# Using uv\r\nuv run main.py\r\n\r\n# Using python\r\npython main.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nRun the test suite using `pytest`:\r\n```bash\r\npytest\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Development Conventions\r\n\r\n*   **Async/Await:** The project heavily relies on Python's `asyncio` and `Telethon`'s async methods. Ensure all I/O bound operations are non-blocking.\r\n*   **Type Hinting:** Use standard Python type hints (`typing` module) for all function signatures and class attributes.\r\n*   **UI/UX:**\r\n    *   Use `telegram_manager.ui.components` for all user output to maintain the Cyberpunk aesthetic.\r\n    *   Prefer `rich` consoles over standard `print()`.\r\n    *   Adhere to the color palette defined in `telegram_manager.ui.theme`.\r\n*   **Error Handling:**\r\n    *   Gracefully handle Telegram-specific errors (e.g., `FloodWaitError`).\r\n    *   Use custom exception classes where appropriate.\r\n    *   Log errors using the configured logger.\r\n*   **Code Style:** Follow PEP 8. The project is configured for `black` and `isort`.\r\n\r\n## Key Files\r\n\r\n*   `main.py`: Application entry point. Orchestrates the connection, scan, and export flow.\r\n*   `telegram_manager/core/client.py`: Manages the `Telethon` client session and connection lifecycle.\r\n*   `telegram_manager/core/scanner.py`: Contains `TelegramScanner` logic for iterating and classifying dialogs.\r\n*   `telegram_manager/core/exporter.py`: Handles data export to JSON and CSV formats.\r\n*   `telegram_manager/ui/theme.py`: Defines the Synthwave color palette and styles.\r\n*   `telegram_manager/utils/config.py`: Loads and validates environment variables.\r\n*   `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration and dependency management (modern standard).\r\n*   `requirements.txt`: Legacy dependency file.\r\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\n# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\n**Metadata Quality:** The `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when Claude will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited*)\n\n*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nTo create a skill, follow the \"Skill Creation Process\" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAlso, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., \"To accomplish X, do Y\" rather than \"You should do X\" or \"If you need to do X\"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.\n\nTo complete SKILL.md, answer the following questions:\n\n1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?\n2. When should the skill be used?\n3. In practice, how should Claude use the skill? All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that Claude knows how to use them.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce the skill is ready, it should be packaged into a distributable zip file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a zip file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.zip`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n\n</skill>"}]}}

Common patterns:\r\n\r\n**1. Workflow-Based** (best for sequential processes)\r\n- Works well when there are clear step-by-step procedures\r\n- Example: DOCX skill with \"Workflow Decision Tree\" → \"Reading\" → \"Creating\" → \"Editing\"\r\n- Structure: ## Overview → ## Workflow Decision Tree → ## Step 1 → ## Step 2...\r\n\r\n**2. Task-Based** (best for tool collections)\r\n- Works well when the skill offers different operations/capabilities\r\n- Example: PDF skill with \"Quick Start\" → \"Merge PDFs\" → \"Split PDFs\" → \"Extract Text\"\r\n- Structure: ## Overview → ## Quick Start → ## Task Category 1 → ## Task Category 2...\r\n\r\n**3. Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)\r\n- Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements\r\n- Example: Brand styling with \"Brand Guidelines\" → \"Colors\" → \"Typography\" → \"Features\"\r\n- Structure: ## Overview → ## Guidelines → ## Specifications → ## Usage...\r\n\r\n**4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)\r\n- Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features\r\n- Example: Product Management with \"Core Capabilities\" → numbered capability list\r\n- Structure: ## Overview → ## Core Capabilities → ### 1. Feature → ### 2. Feature...\r\n\r\nPatterns can be mixed and matched as needed. Most skills combine patterns (e.g., start with task-based, add workflow for complex operations).\r\n\r\nDelete this entire \"Structuring This Skill\" section when done - it's just guidance.]\r\n\r\n## [TODO: Replace with the first main section based on chosen structure]\r\n\r\n[TODO: Add content here. See examples in existing skills:\r\n- Code samples for technical skills\r\n- Decision trees for complex workflows\r\n- Concrete examples with realistic user requests\r\n- References to scripts/templates/references as needed]\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\nThis skill includes example resource directories that demonstrate how to organize different types of bundled resources:\r\n\r\n### scripts/\r\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) that can be run directly to perform specific operations.\r\n\r\n**Examples from other skills:**\r\n- PDF skill: `fill_fillable_fields.py`, `extract_form_field_info.py` - utilities for PDF manipulation\r\n- DOCX skill: `document.py`, `utilities.py` - Python modules for document processing\r\n\r\n**Appropriate for:** Python scripts, shell scripts, or any executable code that performs automation, data processing, or specific operations.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Scripts may be executed without loading into context, but can still be read by Claude for patching or environment adjustments.\r\n\r\n### references/\r\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\r\n\r\n**Examples from other skills:**\r\n- Product management: `communication.md`, `context_building.md` - detailed workflow guides\r\n- BigQuery: API reference documentation and query examples\r\n- Finance: Schema documentation, company policies\r\n\r\n**Appropriate for:** In-depth documentation, API references, database schemas, comprehensive guides, or any detailed information that Claude should reference while working.\r\n\r\n### assets/\r\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\r\n\r\n**Examples from other skills:**\r\n- Brand styling: PowerPoint template files (.pptx), logo files\r\n- Frontend builder: HTML/React boilerplate project directories\r\n- Typography: Font files (.ttf, .woff2)\r\n\r\n**Appropriate for:** Templates, boilerplate code, document templates, images, icons, fonts, or any files meant to be copied or used in the final output.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Any unneeded directories can be deleted.** Not every skill requires all three types of resources.\r\n"}}
