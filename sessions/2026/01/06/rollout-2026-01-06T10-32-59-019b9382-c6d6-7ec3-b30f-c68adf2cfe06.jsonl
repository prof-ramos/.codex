It allows searching by ID, username, or phone number.\n\n## Project Structure\n```\nTeleScam/\n├── telescan.py              # Main application file (137 lines)\n├── requirements.txt         # Dependencies (pyrogram, colorama, tqdm)\n├── api_creds.ini           # Telegram API credentials (DO NOT COMMIT)\n├── README.md               # User documentation\n├── DEVELOPER.md            # Detailed developer guide (Portuguese)\n├── AGENTS.md               # This file - AI agent guidelines\n├── LICENSE                 # MIT License\n└── .blackboxrules          # \"Always in pt-br\"\n```\n\n**Key Architectural Notes:**\n- Single-file application with all logic in `telescan.py`\n- Interactive CLI with while loop menu system\n- Context manager pattern for Telegram client: `with app:`\n- Functions follow single responsibility principle\n- Print functions are separated from logic functions\n\n## Development Commands\n\n### Running the Application\n```bash\npython3 telescan.py api_creds.ini\n```\n\n### Installing Dependencies\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### Testing\nNo test framework is currently configured. When adding tests, use pytest:\n```bash\n# Run all tests\npytest\n\n# Run a single test file\npytest tests/test_module.py\n\n# Run a specific test function\npytest tests/test_module.py::test_function_name\n\n# Run tests with verbose output\npytest -v\n\n# Run tests with coverage\npytest --cov=telescan\n\n# Run tests in watch mode\npytest -w\n```\n\n**Test Structure Guidelines:**\n- Place tests in `tests/` directory\n- Use `unittest.mock` to mock Telegram API calls\n- Test naming: `test_functionName_expectedBehavior`\n- Integration tests should use test API credentials\n\n### Code Quality\nConsider adding these tools to the project:\n- **Linting**: `ruff` or `flake8` for code style\n- **Formatting**: `black` for consistent formatting\n- **Type Checking**: `mypy` for static type checking\n- **Testing**: `pytest` for unit tests\n\n**Recommended Configuration Files:**\n- `pyproject.toml` for tool configuration\n- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for automated checks\n- `ruff.toml` or setup.cfg for linting rules\n\n## Code Style Guidelines\n\n### Language Requirements\n- **User-facing strings**: Portuguese (pt-br) - all print statements and user input prompts must be in Portuguese\n- **Variable/function names**: English - use English for code identifiers\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- **Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `userID`, `chatListPrint`, `singleUserLookup`)\n- **Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `cFile`, `_id`, `_type`, `_title`)\n- **Private variables**: Prefix with underscore (e.g., `_id`, `_type`, `_title`)\n- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`, `TIMEOUT_SECONDS`)\n\n### Import Style\n- Group imports: standard library first, then third-party packages\n- One import per line is preferred for clarity\n- Current codebase uses mixed imports (standard lib on same line)\n- Example:\n  ```python\n  import time\n  import sys\n\n  from colorama import init, Fore, Style\n  from pyrogram import Client\n  from pyrogram.errors import BadRequest, FloodWait, UnknownError\n  from tqdm import tqdm\n  ```\n\n**Current Import Pattern in Codebase:**\n```python\nimport time, sys  # Standard library (can be on same line)\n\nfrom colorama import init, Fore, Style\nfrom pyrogram import Client\nfrom pyrogram.errors import BadRequest, FloodWait, UnknownError\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n- Use specific exception handling from the libraries being used\n- Current project catches: `BadRequest`, `FloodWait`, `UnknownError`\n- Always handle expected errors gracefully with user feedback\n- Example:\n  ```python\n  try:\n      members = app.get_chat_member(chat_id=int(chatID), user_id=userID(userInput))\n  except BadRequest as e:\n      if \"USER_NOT_PARTICIPANT\" in str(e):\n          print(Fore.RED + \"User not in chat\" + Style.RESET_ALL)\n      else:\n          print(str(e))\n  ```\n\n### Formatting Guidelines\n- Use 4 spaces for indentation (standard Python)\n- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black default) or 100 characters (more flexible)\n- Use string formatting with `.format()` or f-strings (preferred)\n- Separate functions with two blank lines\n\n### Type Hints\n- Type hints are not currently used in the codebase but should be added when modifying functions\n- Example:\n  ```python\n  def userID(userInput: str) -> str | int:\n      if userInput.startswith(\"pn-\") or userInput.startswith(\"u-\"):\n          return userInput.split('-')[1]\n      elif userInput.startswith(\"id-\"):\n          return int(userInput.split('-')[1])\n  ```\n\n### Constants and Configuration\n- Configuration files: `.ini` format for API credentials\n- Session management: Use Pyrogram's Client session_name parameter\n- Initialize colorama with `init(autoreset=True)` at the start\n\n### Code Patterns\n- Use context managers for the Telegram client: `with app:`\n- Separate print functions from logic functions\n- Single responsibility: Each function should do one thing\n- Example pattern:\n  ```python\n  def chatListPrint(data):\n      _id = data['id']\n      _type = data['type']\n      _title = data['title']\n      print(\"[id] {} | Título: {} | Tipo: {}\".format(_id, _title, _type))\n  ```\n\n**Function Patterns in Codebase:**\n- `userID(userInput)` - Parses user input with prefixes (id-, u-, pn-)\n- `chatListPrint(data)` - Prints chat information with Portuguese labels\n- `singleUserLookup(user)` - Displays detailed user information\n- `chatMembersInfoPrint(data, total=True)` - Prints member lists with optional totals\n\n### User Interface\n- Use colorama for colored terminal output\n- Always reset colors after colored text: `Style.RESET_ALL`\n- Provide clear prompts with color coding:\n  - Cyan (`Fore.CYAN`): User prompts and normal output\n  - Green (`Fore.GREEN`): Success messages\n  - Red (`Fore.RED`): Errors and warnings\n\n### When Adding Features\n1. Follow existing naming conventions (camelCase for functions/variables)\n2. Add error handling for all external API calls\n3. Include user feedback in Portuguese\n4. Use colorama for terminal output consistency\n5. Consider adding type hints if modifying existing functions\n6. Write tests for new functionality using pytest\n\n### Git Workflow\n- No pre-commit hooks are configured\n- Before pushing, manually run:\n  ```bash\n  python3 telescan.py api_creds.ini  # Basic smoke test\n  ```\n- Ensure no credentials are committed (api_creds.ini should be in .gitignore)\n- Use conventional commit messages when possible\n- Branch naming: `feature/description`, `fix/description`, `docs/description`\n\n## Important Notes\n- API credentials are stored in `api_creds.ini` - never commit this file\n- The project uses Pyrogram v2.0.106\n- Requires Telegram API credentials from https://my.telegram.org/\n- FloodWait exceptions indicate rate limiting - handle appropriately\n- You must be in a group to search its members (unless you're an admin of a channel)\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources.

Also use when user wants to transcribe or get captions/subtitles from a YouTube video. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/youtube-transcript/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"f59f015f2308d39e9d4feae48c1a63186b92b202","branch":"main","repository_url":"https://github.com/prof-ramos/TeleScam.git"}}}

It allows searching by ID, username, or phone number.\n\n## Project Structure\n```\nTeleScam/\n├── telescan.py              # Main application file (137 lines)\n├── requirements.txt         # Dependencies (pyrogram, colorama, tqdm)\n├── api_creds.ini           # Telegram API credentials (DO NOT COMMIT)\n├── README.md               # User documentation\n├── DEVELOPER.md            # Detailed developer guide (Portuguese)\n├── AGENTS.md               # This file - AI agent guidelines\n├── LICENSE                 # MIT License\n└── .blackboxrules          # \"Always in pt-br\"\n```\n\n**Key Architectural Notes:**\n- Single-file application with all logic in `telescan.py`\n- Interactive CLI with while loop menu system\n- Context manager pattern for Telegram client: `with app:`\n- Functions follow single responsibility principle\n- Print functions are separated from logic functions\n\n## Development Commands\n\n### Running the Application\n```bash\npython3 telescan.py api_creds.ini\n```\n\n### Installing Dependencies\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### Testing\nNo test framework is currently configured. When adding tests, use pytest:\n```bash\n# Run all tests\npytest\n\n# Run a single test file\npytest tests/test_module.py\n\n# Run a specific test function\npytest tests/test_module.py::test_function_name\n\n# Run tests with verbose output\npytest -v\n\n# Run tests with coverage\npytest --cov=telescan\n\n# Run tests in watch mode\npytest -w\n```\n\n**Test Structure Guidelines:**\n- Place tests in `tests/` directory\n- Use `unittest.mock` to mock Telegram API calls\n- Test naming: `test_functionName_expectedBehavior`\n- Integration tests should use test API credentials\n\n### Code Quality\nConsider adding these tools to the project:\n- **Linting**: `ruff` or `flake8` for code style\n- **Formatting**: `black` for consistent formatting\n- **Type Checking**: `mypy` for static type checking\n- **Testing**: `pytest` for unit tests\n\n**Recommended Configuration Files:**\n- `pyproject.toml` for tool configuration\n- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for automated checks\n- `ruff.toml` or setup.cfg for linting rules\n\n## Code Style Guidelines\n\n### Language Requirements\n- **User-facing strings**: Portuguese (pt-br) - all print statements and user input prompts must be in Portuguese\n- **Variable/function names**: English - use English for code identifiers\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- **Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `userID`, `chatListPrint`, `singleUserLookup`)\n- **Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `cFile`, `_id`, `_type`, `_title`)\n- **Private variables**: Prefix with underscore (e.g., `_id`, `_type`, `_title`)\n- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`, `TIMEOUT_SECONDS`)\n\n### Import Style\n- Group imports: standard library first, then third-party packages\n- One import per line is preferred for clarity\n- Current codebase uses mixed imports (standard lib on same line)\n- Example:\n  ```python\n  import time\n  import sys\n\n  from colorama import init, Fore, Style\n  from pyrogram import Client\n  from pyrogram.errors import BadRequest, FloodWait, UnknownError\n  from tqdm import tqdm\n  ```\n\n**Current Import Pattern in Codebase:**\n```python\nimport time, sys  # Standard library (can be on same line)\n\nfrom colorama import init, Fore, Style\nfrom pyrogram import Client\nfrom pyrogram.errors import BadRequest, FloodWait, UnknownError\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n- Use specific exception handling from the libraries being used\n- Current project catches: `BadRequest`, `FloodWait`, `UnknownError`\n- Always handle expected errors gracefully with user feedback\n- Example:\n  ```python\n  try:\n      members = app.get_chat_member(chat_id=int(chatID), user_id=userID(userInput))\n  except BadRequest as e:\n      if \"USER_NOT_PARTICIPANT\" in str(e):\n          print(Fore.RED + \"User not in chat\" + Style.RESET_ALL)\n      else:\n          print(str(e))\n  ```\n\n### Formatting Guidelines\n- Use 4 spaces for indentation (standard Python)\n- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black default) or 100 characters (more flexible)\n- Use string formatting with `.format()` or f-strings (preferred)\n- Separate functions with two blank lines\n\n### Type Hints\n- Type hints are not currently used in the codebase but should be added when modifying functions\n- Example:\n  ```python\n  def userID(userInput: str) -> str | int:\n      if userInput.startswith(\"pn-\") or userInput.startswith(\"u-\"):\n          return userInput.split('-')[1]\n      elif userInput.startswith(\"id-\"):\n          return int(userInput.split('-')[1])\n  ```\n\n### Constants and Configuration\n- Configuration files: `.ini` format for API credentials\n- Session management: Use Pyrogram's Client session_name parameter\n- Initialize colorama with `init(autoreset=True)` at the start\n\n### Code Patterns\n- Use context managers for the Telegram client: `with app:`\n- Separate print functions from logic functions\n- Single responsibility: Each function should do one thing\n- Example pattern:\n  ```python\n  def chatListPrint(data):\n      _id = data['id']\n      _type = data['type']\n      _title = data['title']\n      print(\"[id] {} | Título: {} | Tipo: {}\".format(_id, _title, _type))\n  ```\n\n**Function Patterns in Codebase:**\n- `userID(userInput)` - Parses user input with prefixes (id-, u-, pn-)\n- `chatListPrint(data)` - Prints chat information with Portuguese labels\n- `singleUserLookup(user)` - Displays detailed user information\n- `chatMembersInfoPrint(data, total=True)` - Prints member lists with optional totals\n\n### User Interface\n- Use colorama for colored terminal output\n- Always reset colors after colored text: `Style.RESET_ALL`\n- Provide clear prompts with color coding:\n  - Cyan (`Fore.CYAN`): User prompts and normal output\n  - Green (`Fore.GREEN`): Success messages\n  - Red (`Fore.RED`): Errors and warnings\n\n### When Adding Features\n1. Follow existing naming conventions (camelCase for functions/variables)\n2. Add error handling for all external API calls\n3. Include user feedback in Portuguese\n4. Use colorama for terminal output consistency\n5. Consider adding type hints if modifying existing functions\n6. Write tests for new functionality using pytest\n\n### Git Workflow\n- No pre-commit hooks are configured\n- Before pushing, manually run:\n  ```bash\n  python3 telescan.py api_creds.ini  # Basic smoke test\n  ```\n- Ensure no credentials are committed (api_creds.ini should be in .gitignore)\n- Use conventional commit messages when possible\n- Branch naming: `feature/description`, `fix/description`, `docs/description`\n\n## Important Notes\n- API credentials are stored in `api_creds.ini` - never commit this file\n- The project uses Pyrogram v2.0.106\n- Requires Telegram API credentials from https://my.telegram.org/\n- FloodWait exceptions indicate rate limiting - handle appropriately\n- You must be in a group to search its members (unless you're an admin of a channel)\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources.

Use at the start of every Claude Code session when the user provides their first prompt, and whenever the user switches to a distinctly new high-level task. Helps developers manage multiple Claude Code terminals by providing clear, at-a-glance identification of what each terminal is working on. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/claude-code-terminal-title/SKILL.md)\n- test-driven-development: Use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md)\n- test-fixing: Run tests and systematically fix all failing tests using smart error grouping. Use when user asks to fix failing tests, mentions test failures, runs test suite and failures occur, or requests to make tests pass. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/test-fixing/SKILL.md)\n- theme-factory: Toolkit for styling artifacts with a theme. These artifacts can be slides, docs, reportings, HTML landing pages, etc. There are 10 pre-set themes with colors/fonts that you can apply to any artifact that has been creating, or can generate a new theme on-the-fly. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/theme-factory/SKILL.md)\n- timeline-creator: Create HTML timelines and project roadmaps with Gantt charts, milestones, phase groupings, and progress indicators. Use when users request timelines, roadmaps, Gantt charts, project schedules, or milestone visualizations. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/timeline-creator/SKILL.md)\n- ui-ux-a11y-static-review: This skill should be used when performing static UI/UX and accessibility reviews of frontend codebases and producing a three-step report (context mapping, violations, executive synthesis) from code only. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/ui-ux-a11y-static-review/SKILL.md)\n- using-git-worktrees: Use when starting feature work that needs isolation from current workspace or before executing implementation plans - creates isolated git worktrees with smart directory selection and safety verification (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md)\n- webapp-testing: Toolkit for interacting with and testing local web applications using Playwright. Supports verifying frontend functionality, debugging UI behavior, capturing browser screenshots, and viewing browser logs. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/webapp-testing/SKILL.md)\n- xlsx: Comprehensive spreadsheet creation, editing, and analysis with support for formulas, formatting, data analysis, and visualization. When Claude needs to work with spreadsheets (.xlsx, .xlsm, .csv, .tsv, etc) for: (1) Creating new spreadsheets with formulas and formatting, (2) Reading or analyzing data, (3) Modify existing spreadsheets while preserving formulas, (4) Data analysis and visualization in spreadsheets, or (5) Recalculating formulas (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/xlsx/SKILL.md)\n- youtube-downloader: Download YouTube videos with customizable quality and format options. Use this skill when the user asks to download, save, or grab YouTube videos. Supports various quality settings (best, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p), multiple formats (mp4, webm, mkv), and audio-only downloads as MP3.

Also use when user wants to transcribe or get captions/subtitles from a YouTube video. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/youtube-transcript/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Use at the start of every Claude Code session when the user provides their first prompt, and whenever the user switches to a distinctly new high-level task. Helps developers manage multiple Claude Code terminals by providing clear, at-a-glance identification of what each terminal is working on.\r\nmin_claude_code_version: \"1.0.0\"\r\nversion: \"1.1.0\"\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Terminal Title\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nAutomatically sets descriptive terminal window titles based on the task Claude is working on. Essential for developers running multiple Claude Code instances who need to quickly identify which terminal is handling which task.\r\n\r\n## When to Use\r\n\r\n**Always trigger this skill:**\r\n- At the start of every new Claude Code session (after receiving the first user prompt)\r\n- When switching to a substantially different task (e.g., from \"API Integration\" to \"Database Migration\")\r\n\r\n**Trigger on task switches like these:**\r\n- Switching from frontend work to backend work\r\n- Moving from debugging to new feature development\r\n- Changing from one module/component to a completely different one\r\n- Starting work on a different part of the system (e.g., from auth to payments)\r\n\r\n**Do NOT trigger for:**\r\n- Follow-up questions about the same task (\"Can you add a comment to that function?\")\r\n- Small refinements to current work (\"Make it blue instead of red\")\r\n- Debugging the same feature you just built\r\n- Clarifications (\"What did you mean by X?\")\r\n- Iterating on the same component or module\r\n- Mid-task status updates or progress checks\r\n\r\n## How It Works\r\n\r\n1. **Extract Task Summary**: Analyze the user's prompt to identify the high-level task\r\n2. **Generate Title**: Create a concise, descriptive title (max 40 characters)\r\n3. **Set Title**: Execute the `scripts/set_title.sh` script with the generated title\r\n4. **No Confirmation Needed**: This happens automatically in the background\r\n\r\n## Title Format Guidelines\r\n\r\n**Good titles:**\r\n- \"API Integration: Auth Flow\"\r\n- \"Fix: Login Bug\"\r\n- \"DB Migration: Users Table\"\r\n- \"Build: Dashboard UI\"\r\n- \"Refactor: Payment Module\"\r\n\r\n**Bad titles:**\r\n- Too long: \"Implementing the new authentication system with OAuth2.0 support\" (exceeds 40 chars)\r\n- Too generic: \"Working\" or \"Coding\"\r\n- Too verbose: \"The user wants me to help them with...\"\r\n\r\n**Format pattern:**\r\n```\r\n[Action/Category]: [Specific Focus]\r\n```\r\n\r\nKeep titles concise, actionable, and immediately recognizable.\r\n\r\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\r\n\r\n**❌ Too Verbose:**\r\n- Bad: \"Working on implementing the user authentication system with JWT tokens\"\r\n- Good: \"Build: JWT Auth\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Too Vague:**\r\n- Bad: \"Code stuff\"\r\n- Bad: \"Working\"\r\n- Good: \"Refactor: API Layer\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Including System Information:**\r\n- Bad: \"john-macbook-pro: Debug app\"\r\n- Bad: \"/Users/john/project: Build feature\"\r\n- Good: \"Debug: App Issues\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Using Complete Sentences:**\r\n- Bad: \"I am working on the dashboard component\"\r\n- Good: \"Build: Dashboard UI\"\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n**Execute the title script:**\r\n```bash\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Your Title Here\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# User asks: \"Help me debug the authentication flow in the API\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Debug: Auth API Flow\"\r\n\r\n# User asks: \"Create a React component for the user profile page\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Build: User Profile UI\"\r\n\r\n# User asks: \"Write tests for the payment processing module\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Test: Payment Module\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Script Details\r\n\r\nThe `scripts/set_title.sh` script uses ANSI escape sequences to set the terminal title. It's compatible with:\r\n- macOS Terminal\r\n- iTerm2\r\n- Alacritty\r\n- Most modern terminal emulators (xterm, rxvt, screen, tmux)\r\n\r\nThe script accepts a single argument (the title string) and exits silently if no title is provided (fail-safe behavior).\r\n\r\n## Optional Customization\r\n\r\nUsers can optionally customize terminal titles with a prefix by setting the `CLAUDE_TITLE_PREFIX` environment variable:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport CLAUDE_TITLE_PREFIX=\"🤖 Claude\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis produces titles like: `🤖 Claude | Build: Dashboard UI`\r\n\r\nWithout the prefix, titles remain in the standard format: `Build: Dashboard UI`\r\n\r\n**Note:** You don't need to check for this variable or modify your behavior. The script handles this automatically.\r\n"}}

Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.\r\n\r\n## The Process\r\n\r\n**Understanding the idea:**\r\n- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)\r\n- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea\r\n- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too\r\n- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions\r\n- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria\r\n\r\n**Exploring approaches:**\r\n- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs\r\n- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning\r\n- Lead with your recommended option and explain why\r\n\r\n**Presenting the design:**\r\n- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design\r\n- Break it into sections of 200-300 words\r\n- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far\r\n- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing\r\n- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense\r\n\r\n## After the Design\r\n\r\n**Documentation:**\r\n- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`\r\n- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available\r\n- Commit the design document to git\r\n\r\n**Implementation (if continuing):**\r\n- Ask: \"Ready to set up for implementation?\"\r\n- Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create isolated workspace\r\n- Use superpowers:writing-plans to create detailed implementation plan\r\n\r\n## Key Principles\r\n\r\n- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions\r\n- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible\r\n- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs\r\n- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling\r\n- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each\r\n- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense\r\n"}}

This approach aims to satisfy the user’s requests for venv checking, dependency validation, and simple run/stop commands."}],"content":null,"encrypted_content":"gAAAAABpXSEOei4h1uRyvRPq6kUcbm_5fHhh2rlRDQODZOJNo7uaUtAuMpR7MKeFkoW6B1N6HXwDgamZTgB_1ukqEzor_64dfzW2KzvAqIuHzJ26Ef8n0sShsRC5XejBAnWJaUC8kKK4yskyfx_S_-FKenu4BeFwMZcpiPBw3J2Aw9oaZJXQpbbP_hjPVU8K-TSEJRFQ79hteUn06xiSz-9W6yZadu8f7yrOHEU3VelAkDoRn1D9jNPkkNKw4LhNUK_0Ia_QsmvD02BnKHsXanr992hUqJ5bABzko-mKYg0nxQyHUKJvwnOQciOrZ66NhUTQNFzOSlaUx0OKtdM-ODLxXGa6MlpwIix5v98yyjUWTU5Xe8U0YH8w33_BVeNVoXeUgiEEXXKBjP86gyVtQ4ji3AMbSxmnA0AJ2AGOiywsINhfwCT4ohnm5r8iskIZJ5etEvHcpENdkQj_BLJqy5eTbciGFMOgc-giTbz2DeCGKtXDQxQUMBqpf3UUAfYq946Dcly225KhanDB8398l7uD_yPwU9kIFD6cqp3v2IDpyX6jYoVEOFTil_02srI2JTjrrJOJzO_lzwADdC6X6fZAiSXCWjY2eLoBOkuRiOkqaCAZLbxhISEO91EGfYbdTkceRmbEoDpGJYIo5o1c6MDUtoCueTUtPBZZRX66FtoAvL1VEWHxkPHOCFwtDvirNCtzC2W3IbVL4rgemS5lh8LQ2ELYGaIJG7OJrLEdaN28Cm7ljoU3OZMJQVbsGp86J6U6yH4Wp5BVwd-WYSwalqCavlHmhfsJt6VjhC_y9Gvse6kGebhcuAG5maOIccIl-HMBETnQT5JEmyNHqVvrIw_EC7uNeQTD4D4CFJF51V7a84uschfcji5WuwniEtgcwRBy0lCkBiRjTZRBjckZKiXrvjd44ELcERfFRfskgcZ9Pr1ENuVAuYpOniKCWH3phqQZIpcOk0V6dKgfqTY9KFSEE5vsT13Zh7P6eDDqpw3Vh5WKSzrRJ-WOqIvBKyOPcNoKfJiNvd-IIHkC-Il5WWoxVDrv_mz07P54Vu-II3Spbl_GFPjpioJbuQt6xJvlpIuYkxcJt1Kxbltj2H4Z93YI-IS-KRutqXDHy76GUAXQj05Sn5WE_P6l2iD7ub2N_CdohIYvA8dQPOOZ26cLy5J_OVZBrULA6W4mmzboe47lrjK_kYE59jhvfmyMUqYq5ScPVNUwOKRkt1BNLfWxnDBLch20TMu9HJ9jVg-b_KyJ6_2fUphdSiWA7jk0fuAhttqp_PS7sPCuLOExRs_Spzqre9tp47IchfSXVL-a8NqBt3y3bD0mPIfIxs9F2uG192VdkcF7ubyPmRGBGb4bTl1SLIrf_ZiwKMBxeQ_AzkytrB3VnvS4BYmVLSyp89kVQDhUPoB2goPClEDY8YgW_8DxQUlXQN2FFka85UDb3Xw2pErY1_gg11ivmAkFmp7LmEoqRjmGAxQBXX5q-zL1yNp8cLCHXzlh_GZGMNVkqTJY8CR12cic46WmoLz_pBIwo3YZFQPTJzxdy4MpgQhV-1PSvPRw4jMIaQ6zLtc9xB847U5aBe-rwFqrlk8ZaqMdAiHquu-Fqrd3X3x_0OCaPwasoHYW9sYB4G2MwzISx3UF2KkCihyAsCJSD9jBDodsQqYRjPIybmzepiMLGKM1yvUpO3f2Hkom8d2xWLZgfr9JaW4Vv8VQvVXHmgwD6bHZfZ5cF1elbkd9s6bslBXapA5Sp2oah9CG0L2V18Q0lOegKBYPsTwbiTVa4iHlUwXu6Erexefq2nk5A4Tztkj5Z5gJjacVjEFzEAI75kIyB4OTXG8oe4k5h7A1zNtuh2qxp-Ewj-zWQ24fOBMNQIq02LDLKHvFwrpJHwet9vjEd80fzIguQvRkI_ZjcBuAaRUyflZNoChF_SRDJ5_MA77RLSnn3O0bG8zu70mvsVPAac_XJGQE_9-N9xBx1hKCQFeBRmgTBuO4Ajh4ZJY9wBGN0tcU39hgYVeCc2wqEGDBAQVj8Dy-STFarKy0N1jg3nDayk_toajQDrq76HsAhLyZgbNNU94zn8rwSUr3NKJhVKq7QvrX01o996Pnd_cFqtmdUfvMPZE9QQ9WVLYAqMY5ytbyoKXAOF1ZxrEgvVBD4K9L_84IyWbVDeI7LPUccbM0T23Ga45UU3pzBs-bGPTQmYeKOp2Hv-ljd70pBQ-0mEXenqCKHu5QAZRJPDTHYRwat9j4U2G257rxNmni3w6X3K32o66G47YWSTY70VRhE9uiyRxq2XEYSDsya8JBHGh5bkU_ndrmU7pjB36xbTUUfulEZn8K2ynNBIRNW7u2MbD_Wwhd-J17bJRFtcMZxouhBieOYZF-ygaMEcyt5BI-AZ_JO4a3cclqjeTOkNtWbG_ru81eG7bvrMYg4gFAnPuhQnKBG-BZaKCdVCaZYk_EY0mGYzWViU_d9-x8_VQDiIm-qB1H1A9TugmmTK14hBqPnkqH7S06iYA2k6kcWBtfr9qzAzT8SUGWZnXjccOpOO7N0mPq8lYvhRKVvuQJLMR2FLgk61sKyn_6D1iIyg9Ruzp-Vd9MRygHUKOe8oCQY_p6bmGplmCIucUU2MqeU0gZfXmPnBTUg7qBymIOUyi4zxizoc1gi3P7DE0mWZjDcr7CwvJyXRIOf-_GNNMWQdkJu0zv2S8Er4CLSnEVML0g6M2HA2vuCxG_3403L1AM6xPFuEg7wJwuJveYC4s1cKjHQo_vQhqAIgioHLhm74677gU37yHf9CCFTTU0nYv59ckxt4Z4jUOotpOWk_M0LS-HfnqkPi4mhLbcFh9Q0hdwJFeOmtTKWOKRlda5I9Gey9NSCT6ZrdfZVXYAWDqNmhicCR4d-iAuzQ0z8K-1EWP300NMQ6J-pChyy59tVJlDsBAjEZYRK7w0eiFGMQO4w7mAf7vSm-aDQOrV-Z-f72JEdyrAv47mLFKZ_BZwi7y_QmoxmURdVxaICCPzhax89vObx2a8y8DCRk970zpGBq4LvmS_8wqKhuPp0O5lTNl-MSr2NOqdNnxea-fhxmPCtU264vMsYnp-q8tM0_L2EwXxrISzC2-nh5xoBoncaOJMks_jcG90MRO5u0O17hRG83ZIpQ0zhrdBYu442BqZ-BQTgIpfQHD5zXJtnRu--1XSGV945nekTTZyBUMQk_k_ArQdyaOAhMOcNIxklKaHZJ9O2Zq1NLl2nJFzuXEnkCCjA0EaEzBS_1gl38TLvIwMfuCYIt0oYA1XzigJPYZPkIf4VtmVKWVfQfnPQvFzRsE3YrX2JZpcR1tnHqodeprThKn7Ly2Nn9l00SpSA-13zP3zzN7STw5u8ZVB2JyMO6aQcYvw08woNAV6gNmUdi-FNLpv7txWijcHM_1lny_FSd-dK6X7On0gkabGhX8SDBmAlmFed8xljJOlZ6-yr3eeXupPkJZI9nr1AOu_Z2Jw7A0upx1JNtVvgG62u9_LsDcxNsjA_D2U-f-RyT2dA_FDYItGsp-PuTucAdfGLz-OG3EJB2Eh4lWvfavp5L2w3-e8IX90eU6KpB9qEoPfYS3QjiDT0-iZdenr64eYAiD4i5Uxcl9mlkuCVn_lDpfhOvT3F6GzUUvIEJOZRqN1CkcBDTJVbbiK1GFnYifE2KzatHNoCRmaZJHPffsY-zHa8JQ9rZH8_9f7dtd7K-Cc9-rcK8tWcNaL2M44XEBlc4fxqOFq7Hnl1bKV0AeqS7OPVqXOwpMDmHetyqb043OrnFZYshCLciSX1Gdf2moXMozW80PbKErLJ1o_ud0bkN3Mi_Eu7Ef6-vhmUeZ1a2SqJZUMQKjyMgVIu2QdJ4x2Vo-IHiHd1FD0NHdE-BmB-pXrxAq6IlmCDb0SguBDjUWVc8aLwhomFpHuVA2CKQx6kmxOqmyxqit_BqLV1rq-z8pcXjEFw_KEnwzK4CtyA9fj7gTRxrG3xEYy_U6bfFHCWGIf4Cd5mfg7t5BjuW303TRJwBoM1KjSzzT96IJ6mfxCsQNFZee2t_A1i1YSAh0x"}}

Error-proof by design. Follow what works. Build only what's needed.\n\n**Core principle:** Many small improvements beat one big change. Prevent errors at design time, not with fixes.\n\n## When to Use\n\n**Always applied for:**\n\n- Code implementation and refactoring\n- Architecture and design decisions\n- Process and workflow improvements\n- Error handling and validation\n\n**Philosophy:** Quality through incremental progress and prevention, not perfection through massive effort.\n\n## The Four Pillars\n\n### 1. Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)\n\nSmall, frequent improvements compound into major gains.\n\n#### Principles\n\n**Incremental over revolutionary:**\n\n- Make smallest viable change that improves quality\n- One improvement at a time\n- Verify each change before next\n- Build momentum through small wins\n\n**Always leave code better:**\n\n- Fix small issues as you encounter them\n- Refactor while you work (within scope)\n- Update outdated comments\n- Remove dead code when you see it\n\n**Iterative refinement:**\n\n- First version: make it work\n- Second pass: make it clear\n- Third pass: make it efficient\n- Don't try all three at once\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\n// Iteration 1: Make it work\nconst calculateTotal = (items: Item[]) => {\n  let total = 0;\n  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {\n    total += items[i].price * items[i].quantity;\n  }\n  return total;\n};\n\n// Iteration 2: Make it clear (refactor)\nconst calculateTotal = (items: Item[]): number => {\n  return items.reduce((total, item) => {\n    return total + (item.price * item.quantity);\n  }, 0);\n};\n\n// Iteration 3: Make it robust (add validation)\nconst calculateTotal = (items: Item[]): number => {\n  if (!items?.length) return 0;\n  \n  return items.reduce((total, item) => {\n    if (item.price < 0 || item.quantity < 0) {\n      throw new Error('Price and quantity must be non-negative');\n    }\n    return total + (item.price * item.quantity);\n  }, 0);\n};\n\n```\nEach step is complete, tested, and working\n</Good>\n\n<Bad>\n```typescript\n// Trying to do everything at once\nconst calculateTotal = (items: Item[]): number => {\n  // Validate, optimize, add features, handle edge cases all together\n  if (!items?.length) return 0;\n  const validItems = items.filter(item => {\n    if (item.price < 0) throw new Error('Negative price');\n    if (item.quantity < 0) throw new Error('Negative quantity');\n    return item.quantity > 0; // Also filtering zero quantities\n  });\n  // Plus caching, plus logging, plus currency conversion...\n  return validItems.reduce(...); // Too many concerns at once\n};\n```\n\nOverwhelming, error-prone, hard to verify\n</Bad>\n\n#### In Practice\n\n**When implementing features:**\n\n1. Start with simplest version that works\n2. Add one improvement (error handling, validation, etc.)\n3. Test and verify\n4. Repeat if time permits\n5. Don't try to make it perfect immediately\n\n**When refactoring:**\n\n- Fix one smell at a time\n- Commit after each improvement\n- Keep tests passing throughout\n- Stop when \"good enough\" (diminishing returns)\n\n**When reviewing code:**\n\n- Suggest incremental improvements (not rewrites)\n- Prioritize: critical → important → nice-to-have\n- Focus on highest-impact changes first\n- Accept \"better than before\" even if not perfect\n\n### 2. Poka-Yoke (Error Proofing)\n\nDesign systems that prevent errors at compile/design time, not runtime.\n\n#### Principles\n\n**Make errors impossible:**\n\n- Type system catches mistakes\n- Compiler enforces contracts\n- Invalid states unrepresentable\n- Errors caught early (left of production)\n\n**Design for safety:**\n\n- Fail fast and loudly\n- Provide helpful error messages\n- Make correct path obvious\n- Make incorrect path difficult\n\n**Defense in layers:**\n\n1. Type system (compile time)\n2. Validation (runtime, early)\n3. Guards (preconditions)\n4. Error boundaries (graceful degradation)\n\n#### Type System Error Proofing\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\n// Error: string status can be any value\ntype OrderBad = {\n  status: string; // Can be \"pending\", \"PENDING\", \"pnding\", anything!\n  total: number;\n};\n\n// Good: Only valid states possible\ntype OrderStatus = 'pending' | 'processing' | 'shipped' | 'delivered';\ntype Order = {\n  status: OrderStatus;\n  total: number;\n};\n\n// Better: States with associated data\ntype Order =\n  | { status: 'pending'; createdAt: Date }\n  | { status: 'processing'; startedAt: Date; estimatedCompletion: Date }\n  | { status: 'shipped'; trackingNumber: string; shippedAt: Date }\n  | { status: 'delivered'; deliveredAt: Date; signature: string };\n\n// Now impossible to have shipped without trackingNumber\n\n```\nType system prevents entire classes of errors\n</Good>\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\n// Make invalid states unrepresentable\ntype NonEmptyArray<T> = [T, ...T[]];\n\nconst firstItem = <T>(items: NonEmptyArray<T>): T => {\n  return items[0]; // Always safe, never undefined!\n};\n\n// Caller must prove array is non-empty\nconst items: number[] = [1, 2, 3];\nif (items.length > 0) {\n  firstItem(items as NonEmptyArray<number>); // Safe\n}\n```\n\nFunction signature guarantees safety\n</Good>\n\n#### Validation Error Proofing\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\n// Error: Validation after use\nconst processPayment = (amount: number) => {\n  const fee = amount * 0.03; // Used before validation!\n  if (amount <= 0) throw new Error('Invalid amount');\n  // ...\n};\n\n// Good: Validate immediately\nconst processPayment = (amount: number) => {\n  if (amount <= 0) {\n    throw new Error('Payment amount must be positive');\n  }\n  if (amount > 10000) {\n    throw new Error('Payment exceeds maximum allowed');\n  }\n  \n  const fee = amount * 0.03;\n  // ... now safe to use\n};\n\n// Better: Validation at boundary with branded type\ntype PositiveNumber = number & { readonly __brand: 'PositiveNumber' };\n\nconst validatePositive = (n: number): PositiveNumber => {\n  if (n <= 0) throw new Error('Must be positive');\n  return n as PositiveNumber;\n};\n\nconst processPayment = (amount: PositiveNumber) => {\n  // amount is guaranteed positive, no need to check\n  const fee = amount * 0.03;\n};\n\n// Validate at system boundary\nconst handlePaymentRequest = (req: Request) => {\n  const amount = validatePositive(req.body.amount); // Validate once\n  processPayment(amount); // Use everywhere safely\n};\n\n```\nValidate once at boundary, safe everywhere else\n</Good>\n\n#### Guards and Preconditions\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\n// Early returns prevent deeply nested code\nconst processUser = (user: User | null) => {\n  if (!user) {\n    logger.error('User not found');\n    return;\n  }\n  \n  if (!user.email) {\n    logger.error('User email missing');\n    return;\n  }\n  \n  if (!user.isActive) {\n    logger.info('User inactive, skipping');\n    return;\n  }\n  \n  // Main logic here, guaranteed user is valid and active\n  sendEmail(user.email, 'Welcome!');\n};\n```\n\nGuards make assumptions explicit and enforced\n</Good>\n\n#### Configuration Error Proofing\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\n// Error: Optional config with unsafe defaults\ntype ConfigBad = {\n  apiKey?: string;\n  timeout?: number;\n};\n\nconst client = new APIClient({ timeout: 5000 }); // apiKey missing!\n\n// Good: Required config, fails early\ntype Config = {\n  apiKey: string;\n  timeout: number;\n};\n\nconst loadConfig = (): Config => {\n  const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;\n  if (!apiKey) {\n    throw new Error('API_KEY environment variable required');\n  }\n  \n  return {\n    apiKey,\n    timeout: 5000,\n  };\n};\n\n// App fails at startup if config invalid, not during request\nconst config = loadConfig();\nconst client = new APIClient(config);\n\n```\nFail at startup, not in production\n</Good>\n\n#### In Practice\n\n**When designing APIs:**\n- Use types to constrain inputs\n- Make invalid states unrepresentable\n- Return Result<T, E> instead of throwing\n- Document preconditions in types\n\n**When handling errors:**\n- Validate at system boundaries\n- Use guards for preconditions\n- Fail fast with clear messages\n- Log context for debugging\n\n**When configuring:**\n- Required over optional with defaults\n- Validate all config at startup\n- Fail deployment if config invalid\n- Don't allow partial configurations\n\n### 3. Standardized Work\n\nFollow established patterns. Document what works. Make good practices easy to follow.\n\n#### Principles\n\n**Consistency over cleverness:**\n- Follow existing codebase patterns\n- Don't reinvent solved problems\n- New pattern only if significantly better\n- Team agreement on new patterns\n\n**Documentation lives with code:**\n- README for setup and architecture\n- CLAUDE.md for AI coding conventions\n- Comments for \"why\", not \"what\"\n- Examples for complex patterns\n\n**Automate standards:**\n- Linters enforce style\n- Type checks enforce contracts\n- Tests verify behavior\n- CI/CD enforces quality gates\n\n#### Following Patterns\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\n// Existing codebase pattern for API clients\nclass UserAPIClient {\n  async getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {\n    return this.fetch(`/users/${id}`);\n  }\n}\n\n// New code follows the same pattern\nclass OrderAPIClient {\n  async getOrder(id: string): Promise<Order> {\n    return this.fetch(`/orders/${id}`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nConsistency makes codebase predictable\n</Good>\n\n<Bad>\n```typescript\n// Existing pattern uses classes\nclass UserAPIClient { /* ... */ }\n\n// New code introduces different pattern without discussion\nconst getOrder = async (id: string): Promise<Order> => {\n  // Breaking consistency \"because I prefer functions\"\n};\n\n```\nInconsistency creates confusion\n</Bad>\n\n#### Error Handling Patterns\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\n// Project standard: Result type for recoverable errors\ntype Result<T, E> = { ok: true; value: T } | { ok: false; error: E };\n\n// All services follow this pattern\nconst fetchUser = async (id: string): Promise<Result<User, Error>> => {\n  try {\n    const user = await db.users.findById(id);\n    if (!user) {\n      return { ok: false, error: new Error('User not found') };\n    }\n    return { ok: true, value: user };\n  } catch (err) {\n    return { ok: false, error: err as Error };\n  }\n};\n\n// Callers use consistent pattern\nconst result = await fetchUser('123');\nif (!result.ok) {\n  logger.error('Failed to fetch user', result.error);\n  return;\n}\nconst user = result.value; // Type-safe!\n```\n\nStandard pattern across codebase\n</Good>\n\n#### Documentation Standards\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\n/**\n * Retries an async operation with exponential backoff.\n *\n * Why: Network requests fail temporarily; retrying improves reliability\n * When to use: External API calls, database operations\n * When not to use: User input validation, internal function calls\n *\n * @example\n * const result = await retry(\n *   () => fetch('https://api.example.com/data'),\n *   { maxAttempts: 3, baseDelay: 1000 }\n * );\n */\nconst retry = async <T>(\n  operation: () => Promise<T>,\n  options: RetryOptions\n): Promise<T> => {\n  // Implementation...\n};\n```\nDocuments why, when, and how\n</Good>\n\n#### In Practice\n\n**Before adding new patterns:**\n\n- Search codebase for similar problems solved\n- Check CLAUDE.md for project conventions\n- Discuss with team if breaking from pattern\n- Update docs when introducing new pattern\n\n**When writing code:**\n\n- Match existing file structure\n- Use same naming conventions\n- Follow same error handling approach\n- Import from same locations\n\n**When reviewing:**\n\n- Check consistency with existing code\n- Point to examples in codebase\n- Suggest aligning with standards\n- Update CLAUDE.md if new standard emerges\n\n### 4. Just-In-Time (JIT)\n\nBuild what's needed now. No more, no less. Avoid premature optimization and over-engineering.\n\n#### Principles\n\n**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):**\n\n- Implement only current requirements\n- No \"just in case\" features\n- No \"we might need this later\" code\n- Delete speculation\n\n**Simplest thing that works:**\n\n- Start with straightforward solution\n- Add complexity only when needed\n- Refactor when requirements change\n- Don't anticipate future needs\n\n**Optimize when measured:**\n\n- No premature optimization\n- Profile before optimizing\n- Measure impact of changes\n- Accept \"good enough\" performance\n\n#### YAGNI in Action\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\n// Current requirement: Log errors to console\nconst logError = (error: Error) => {\n  console.error(error.message);\n};\n```\nSimple, meets current need\n</Good>\n\n<Bad>\n```typescript\n// Over-engineered for \"future needs\"\ninterface LogTransport {\n  write(level: LogLevel, message: string, meta?: LogMetadata): Promise<void>;\n}\n\nclass ConsoleTransport implements LogTransport { /*... */ }\nclass FileTransport implements LogTransport { /* ... */ }\nclass RemoteTransport implements LogTransport { /* ...*/ }\n\nclass Logger {\n  private transports: LogTransport[] = [];\n  private queue: LogEntry[] = [];\n  private rateLimiter: RateLimiter;\n  private formatter: LogFormatter;\n  \n  // 200 lines of code for \"maybe we'll need it\"\n}\n\nconst logError = (error: Error) => {\n  Logger.getInstance().log('error', error.message);\n};\n\n```\nBuilding for imaginary future requirements\n</Bad>\n\n**When to add complexity:**\n- Current requirement demands it\n- Pain points identified through use\n- Measured performance issues\n- Multiple use cases emerged\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\n// Start simple\nconst formatCurrency = (amount: number): string => {\n  return `$${amount.toFixed(2)}`;\n};\n\n// Requirement evolves: support multiple currencies\nconst formatCurrency = (amount: number, currency: string): string => {\n  const symbols = { USD: '$', EUR: '€', GBP: '£' };\n  return `${symbols[currency]}${amount.toFixed(2)}`;\n};\n\n// Requirement evolves: support localization\nconst formatCurrency = (amount: number, locale: string): string => {\n  return new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, {\n    style: 'currency',\n    currency: locale === 'en-US' ? 'USD' : 'EUR',\n  }).format(amount);\n};\n```\n\nComplexity added only when needed\n</Good>\n\n#### Premature Abstraction\n\n<Bad>\n```typescript\n// One use case, but building generic framework\nabstract class BaseCRUDService<T> {\n  abstract getAll(): Promise<T[]>;\n  abstract getById(id: string): Promise<T>;\n  abstract create(data: Partial<T>): Promise<T>;\n  abstract update(id: string, data: Partial<T>): Promise<T>;\n  abstract delete(id: string): Promise<void>;\n}\n\nclass GenericRepository<T> { /*300 lines */ }\nclass QueryBuilder<T> { /* 200 lines*/ }\n// ... building entire ORM for single table\n\n```\nMassive abstraction for uncertain future\n</Bad>\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\n// Simple functions for current needs\nconst getUsers = async (): Promise<User[]> => {\n  return db.query('SELECT * FROM users');\n};\n\nconst getUserById = async (id: string): Promise<User | null> => {\n  return db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [id]);\n};\n\n// When pattern emerges across multiple entities, then abstract\n```\n\nAbstract only when pattern proven across 3+ cases\n</Good>\n\n#### Performance Optimization\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\n// Current: Simple approach\nconst filterActiveUsers = (users: User[]): User[] => {\n  return users.filter(user => user.isActive);\n};\n\n// Benchmark shows: 50ms for 1000 users (acceptable)\n// ✓ Ship it, no optimization needed\n\n// Later: After profiling shows this is bottleneck\n// Then optimize with indexed lookup or caching\n\n```\nOptimize based on measurement, not assumptions\n</Good>\n\n<Bad>\n```typescript\n// Premature optimization\nconst filterActiveUsers = (users: User[]): User[] => {\n  // \"This might be slow, so let's cache and index\"\n  const cache = new WeakMap();\n  const indexed = buildBTreeIndex(users, 'isActive');\n  // 100 lines of optimization code\n  // Adds complexity, harder to maintain\n  // No evidence it was needed\n};\n```\n\nComplex solution for unmeasured problem\n</Bad>\n\n#### In Practice\n\n**When implementing:**\n\n- Solve the immediate problem\n- Use straightforward approach\n- Resist \"what if\" thinking\n- Delete speculative code\n\n**When optimizing:**\n\n- Profile first, optimize second\n- Measure before and after\n- Document why optimization needed\n- Keep simple version in tests\n\n**When abstracting:**\n\n- Wait for 3+ similar cases (Rule of Three)\n- Make abstraction as simple as possible\n- Prefer duplication over wrong abstraction\n- Refactor when pattern clear\n\n## Integration with Commands\n\nThe Kaizen skill guides how you work. The commands provide structured analysis:\n\n- **`/why`**: Root cause analysis (5 Whys)\n- **`/cause-and-effect`**: Multi-factor analysis (Fishbone)\n- **`/plan-do-check-act`**: Iterative improvement cycles\n- **`/analyse-problem`**: Comprehensive documentation (A3)\n- **`/analyse`**: Smart method selection (Gemba/VSM/Muda)\n\nUse commands for structured problem-solving. Apply skill for day-to-day development.\n\n## Red Flags\n\n**Violating Continuous Improvement:**\n\n- \"I'll refactor it later\" (never happens)\n- Leaving code worse than you found it\n- Big bang rewrites instead of incremental\n\n**Violating Poka-Yoke:**\n\n- \"Users should just be careful\"\n- Validation after use instead of before\n- Optional config with no validation\n\n**Violating Standardized Work:**\n\n- \"I prefer to do it my way\"\n- Not checking existing patterns\n- Ignoring project conventions\n\n**Violating Just-In-Time:**\n\n- \"We might need this someday\"\n- Building frameworks before using them\n- Optimizing without measuring\n\n## Remember\n\n**Kaizen is about:**\n\n- Small improvements continuously\n- Preventing errors by design\n- Following proven patterns\n- Building only what's needed\n\n**Not about:**\n\n- Perfection on first try\n- Massive refactoring projects\n- Clever abstractions\n- Premature optimization\n\n**Mindset:** Good enough today, better tomorrow. Repeat.\n\n</skill>"}]}}
