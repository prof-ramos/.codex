Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"36abe56412c28b99e983ed5c24791d40cf5a6feb","branch":"main"}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Use at the start of every Claude Code session when the user provides their first prompt, and whenever the user switches to a distinctly new high-level task. Helps developers manage multiple Claude Code terminals by providing clear, at-a-glance identification of what each terminal is working on.\r\nmin_claude_code_version: \"1.0.0\"\r\nversion: \"1.1.0\"\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Terminal Title\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nAutomatically sets descriptive terminal window titles based on the task Claude is working on. Essential for developers running multiple Claude Code instances who need to quickly identify which terminal is handling which task.\r\n\r\n## When to Use\r\n\r\n**Always trigger this skill:**\r\n- At the start of every new Claude Code session (after receiving the first user prompt)\r\n- When switching to a substantially different task (e.g., from \"API Integration\" to \"Database Migration\")\r\n\r\n**Trigger on task switches like these:**\r\n- Switching from frontend work to backend work\r\n- Moving from debugging to new feature development\r\n- Changing from one module/component to a completely different one\r\n- Starting work on a different part of the system (e.g., from auth to payments)\r\n\r\n**Do NOT trigger for:**\r\n- Follow-up questions about the same task (\"Can you add a comment to that function?\")\r\n- Small refinements to current work (\"Make it blue instead of red\")\r\n- Debugging the same feature you just built\r\n- Clarifications (\"What did you mean by X?\")\r\n- Iterating on the same component or module\r\n- Mid-task status updates or progress checks\r\n\r\n## How It Works\r\n\r\n1. **Extract Task Summary**: Analyze the user's prompt to identify the high-level task\r\n2. **Generate Title**: Create a concise, descriptive title (max 40 characters)\r\n3. **Set Title**: Execute the `scripts/set_title.sh` script with the generated title\r\n4. **No Confirmation Needed**: This happens automatically in the background\r\n\r\n## Title Format Guidelines\r\n\r\n**Good titles:**\r\n- \"API Integration: Auth Flow\"\r\n- \"Fix: Login Bug\"\r\n- \"DB Migration: Users Table\"\r\n- \"Build: Dashboard UI\"\r\n- \"Refactor: Payment Module\"\r\n\r\n**Bad titles:**\r\n- Too long: \"Implementing the new authentication system with OAuth2.0 support\" (exceeds 40 chars)\r\n- Too generic: \"Working\" or \"Coding\"\r\n- Too verbose: \"The user wants me to help them with...\"\r\n\r\n**Format pattern:**\r\n```\r\n[Action/Category]: [Specific Focus]\r\n```\r\n\r\nKeep titles concise, actionable, and immediately recognizable.\r\n\r\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\r\n\r\n**❌ Too Verbose:**\r\n- Bad: \"Working on implementing the user authentication system with JWT tokens\"\r\n- Good: \"Build: JWT Auth\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Too Vague:**\r\n- Bad: \"Code stuff\"\r\n- Bad: \"Working\"\r\n- Good: \"Refactor: API Layer\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Including System Information:**\r\n- Bad: \"john-macbook-pro: Debug app\"\r\n- Bad: \"/Users/john/project: Build feature\"\r\n- Good: \"Debug: App Issues\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Using Complete Sentences:**\r\n- Bad: \"I am working on the dashboard component\"\r\n- Good: \"Build: Dashboard UI\"\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n**Execute the title script:**\r\n```bash\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Your Title Here\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# User asks: \"Help me debug the authentication flow in the API\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Debug: Auth API Flow\"\r\n\r\n# User asks: \"Create a React component for the user profile page\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Build: User Profile UI\"\r\n\r\n# User asks: \"Write tests for the payment processing module\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Test: Payment Module\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Script Details\r\n\r\nThe `scripts/set_title.sh` script uses ANSI escape sequences to set the terminal title. It's compatible with:\r\n- macOS Terminal\r\n- iTerm2\r\n- Alacritty\r\n- Most modern terminal emulators (xterm, rxvt, screen, tmux)\r\n\r\nThe script accepts a single argument (the title string) and exits silently if no title is provided (fail-safe behavior).\r\n\r\n## Optional Customization\r\n\r\nUsers can optionally customize terminal titles with a prefix by setting the `CLAUDE_TITLE_PREFIX` environment variable:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport CLAUDE_TITLE_PREFIX=\"🤖 Claude\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis produces titles like: `🤖 Claude | Build: Dashboard UI`\r\n\r\nWithout the prefix, titles remain in the standard format: `Build: Dashboard UI`\r\n\r\n**Note:** You don't need to check for this variable or modify your behavior. The script handles this automatically.\r\n"}}

Hugo is a framework for building static websites and blogs with content written in Markdown. The project includes a basic blog setup with posts, an about page, and full theme customization through the PaperMod theme, which provides modern styling, dark mode support, and profile mode for the homepage.\r\n\r\n# Recent Changes\r\n\r\n**November 2, 2025**\r\n- **✅ Implementadas Melhorias de UX/UI seguindo Material Design e iOS Guidelines**:\r\n  - **Design Tokens Atualizados**: Sistema de spacing baseado em grid de 8px (--spacing-xs a --spacing-2xl)\r\n  - **Botão Hamburger Mobile**:\r\n    - Touch target aumentado: 44x44px → 48x48px (conforme WCAG 2.2 + Material Design)\r\n    - Linhas mais finas: 3px → 2.5px com gap de 6px\r\n    - Margem de 16px da borda para melhor alcance do polegar\r\n    - Estados hover/active com micro-interações\r\n  - **Menu Sidebar Mobile**:\r\n    - Largura responsiva: clamp(304px, 88vw, 344px) - mais espaço em devices maiores\r\n    - Padding otimizado: 64px topo (respeita status bar) + 24px horizontal\r\n    - Links com altura de 56px (touch target ideal)\r\n    - Espaçamento de 20px entre itens para melhor legibilidade\r\n    - Indicador visual de página ativa com barra lateral de 4px\r\n  - **Header Desktop**:\r\n    - Altura aumentada: 56px → 72px para mais respiro visual\r\n    - Padding vertical: 24px para melhor hierarquia\r\n    - Fonte dos links: 18px (--font-size-menu-desktop)\r\n    - Espaçamento entre itens: 24px (Material Design spec)\r\n    - Active indicator com underline de 3px em vez de borda lateral\r\n  - **Overlay**:\r\n    - Opacity reduzida: 0.6 → 0.45 (menos intrusivo)\r\n    - Transição suave de fade in/out\r\n    - Suporte a `prefers-reduced-motion` para acessibilidade\r\n  - **Tipografia**: Sistema consistente com tokens (base 16px, menu 16px mobile/18px desktop)\r\n  - **Arquivos modificados**: `mobile-first.css` (design tokens + todos os componentes)\r\n  - **Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION-READY - Aprovado pelo Architect\r\n  - **Impacto**: UX mais polida, melhor acessibilidade (WCAG 2.2), touch targets otimizados para mobile\r\n\r\n**October 28, 2025**\r\n- **✅ Implementadas TODAS as 4 Melhorias Opcionais** (documented in `/docs/11-relatorio-melhorias-finais.md`):\r\n  1. **Fallback sem JavaScript**: Menu funciona nativamente com `<details>`/`<summary>` (progressive enhancement)\r\n  2. **Lazy-load Chroma CSS**: Syntax highlighting (~3.5KB) carregado apenas em páginas com código\r\n  3. **Service Worker + PWA**: Cache offline, instalável como app, fallback page (/offline.html)\r\n  4. **WebP Images**: Shortcode `{{< webp-image >}}` com fallback automático para browsers antigos\r\n  - **Todas as 4 tarefas aprovadas pelo Architect** ✅\r\n  - **Impacto**: ~3.5KB economizados em páginas sem código, site funciona offline, imagens 30-50% menores\r\n  - **Arquivos criados**: sw.js, manifest.json, offline.md, webp-image.html, webp-support.js, chroma-lazy.css\r\n  - **Status**: PRODUCTION-READY ✅\r\n- **Implementação Completa Mobile-First CSS** (documented in `/docs/8-diagnostico-mobile-first.md`):\r\n  - **Breakpoints invertidos**: Desktop-first (`max-width`) → Mobile-first (`min-width`)\r\n  - **CSS movido para arquivo externo**: 291 linhas inline → 9 linhas (redução de 97%)\r\n  - **Menu responsivo robusto**: Cria/remove botão dinamicamente conforme viewport\r\n  - **Zero memory leaks**: Event listeners nomeados, removidos corretamente\r\n  - **Event delegation**: 1 listener no menu vs N em cada link\r\n  - **Tokens CSS completos**: Spacing, tipografia fluida (clamp), transitions, shadows\r\n  - **Breakpoints padronizados**: Mobile base → 640px → 769px → 1024px → 1440px\r\n  - **Arquivos criados**: `mobile-first.css` (450 linhas de CSS otimizado)\r\n  - **Arquivos atualizados**: `theme-vars.css` (valores mobile base), `zmedia.css` (min-width)\r\n  - **Performance**: CSS cacheable, debounced resize (150ms), cleanup automático\r\n  - **Impacto total**: -2,527 linhas de código duplicado nos HTML gerados\r\n- **Redesign Minimalista do Menu**:\r\n  - Removido ícones sociais (GitHub, LinkedIn) - mantido apenas Twitter\r\n  - Criado menu de navegação minimalista com efeitos UX/UI modernos\r\n  - Efeitos implementados: glassmorphism, hover com elevação, indicador de página ativa\r\n  - Animações suaves (cubic-bezier) e micro-interações\r\n  - Menu totalmente acessível (focus states, keyboard navigation)\r\n  - Menu hambúrguer mobile: background sutil, borda definida, linhas 3px, sombra\r\n- **Botões de Compartilhamento Personalizados**:\r\n  - Mantidos apenas 3 redes nos posts: Twitter/X, WhatsApp, Instagram\r\n  - Removidos: LinkedIn, Reddit, Facebook, Telegram, YCombinator\r\n- **Implemented 3 Critical Frontend Performance Optimizations** (documented in `/docs/7-otimizacoes-frontend.md`):\r\n  1. **Search System Optimization** (`fastsearch.js`):\r\n     - Lazy loading of search index (loads only when needed)\r\n     - 200ms debounce on search input (reduces CPU by 60-97%)\r\n     - Optimized Fuse.js configuration with weighted keys (70/20/10)\r\n     - DocumentFragment rendering for faster DOM updates\r\n     - Estimated CPU reduction: 60% during search operations\r\n  2. **Event Listener Improvements** (`footer.html`):\r\n     - Event delegation: 70 listeners → 2 (94% memory reduction)\r\n     - Throttled scroll handler with requestAnimationFrame\r\n     - Passive event listeners for better scrolling performance\r\n     - Debounced localStorage writes (100ms)\r\n     - IIFE scope isolation to prevent global pollution\r\n  3. **Critical CSS Separation** (`critical_css.html` + `head.html`):\r\n     - Critical CSS inlined (~4 KB) for instant first paint\r\n     - Full CSS loads asynchronously (preload + onload technique)\r\n     - First Contentful Paint improved by ~50% (1.2s → 0.6s)\r\n     - Zero Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC)\r\n     - Progressive enhancement maintained\r\n  - **Bug fixes during implementation**: Fixed search result clickability and history API URL handling\r\n  - **Overall Impact**: ~50% faster initial load, 97% less bandwidth on repeat visits\r\n- Configured PagesCMS for content management:\r\n  - Created `.pages.yml` configuration file\r\n  - Set up content collections for posts and about page\r\n  - Configured media uploads to `static/images/`\r\n  - Created comprehensive guide in `/docs/5-usando-pagescms.md`\r\n- CMS ready to use at https://pagescms.org (requires GitHub connection)\r\n- Customized footer: Changed from \"Powered by Hugo & PaperMod\" to \"In Memoriam - Zé Bitela (Poeta, seresteiro e cantor)\"\r\n- Completed comprehensive performance analysis (saved to `/docs/6-analise-desempenho.md`):\r\n  - Identified 4 critical bottlenecks: search, CSS bundle, cache headers, JS optimization\r\n  - Estimated 50-60% CPU reduction potential with lazy-loading search index\r\n  - Recommended cache headers for 97% reduction in repeat visit load times\r\n  - Provided prioritized action plan for scaling to 200+ posts\r\n\r\n**October 21, 2025**\r\n- Fixed deployment issues (final):\r\n  - Created missing `google_analytics.html` partial template in PaperMod theme\r\n  - Created dedicated `build.sh` script that ensures Hugo v0.146.0 is used\r\n  - Updated deployment config to use build.sh (bypasses old Nix Hugo v0.126.1)\r\n  -

Reduces cognitive load and keeps your digital workspace tidy without manual effort.\n---\n\n# File Organizer\n\nThis skill acts as your personal organization assistant, helping you maintain a clean, logical file structure across your computer without the mental overhead of constant manual organization.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\n- Your Downloads folder is a chaotic mess\n- You can't find files because they're scattered everywhere\n- You have duplicate files taking up space\n- Your folder structure doesn't make sense anymore\n- You want to establish better organization habits\n- You're starting a new project and need a good structure\n- You're cleaning up before archiving old projects\n\n## What This Skill Does\n\n1. **Analyzes Current Structure**: Reviews your folders and files to understand what you have\n2. **Finds Duplicates**: Identifies duplicate files across your system\n3. **Suggests Organization**: Proposes logical folder structures based on your content\n4. **Automates Cleanup**: Moves, renames, and organizes files with your approval\n5. **Maintains Context**: Makes smart decisions based on file types, dates, and content\n6. **Reduces Clutter**: Identifies old files you probably don't need anymore\n\n## How to Use\n\n### From Your Home Directory\n\n```\ncd ~\n```\n\nThen run Claude Code and ask for help:\n\n```\nHelp me organize my Downloads folder\n```\n\n```\nFind duplicate files in my Documents folder\n```\n\n```\nReview my project directories and suggest improvements\n```\n\n### Specific Organization Tasks\n\n```\nOrganize these downloads into proper folders based on what they are\n```\n\n```\nFind duplicate files and help me decide which to keep\n```\n\n```\nClean up old files I haven't touched in 6+ months\n```\n\n```\nCreate a better folder structure for my [work/projects/photos/etc]\n```\n\n## Instructions\n\nWhen a user requests file organization help:\n\n1. **Understand the Scope**\n   \n   Ask clarifying questions:\n   - Which directory needs organization? (Downloads, Documents, entire home folder?)\n   - What's the main problem? (Can't find things, duplicates, too messy, no structure?)\n   - Any files or folders to avoid? (Current projects, sensitive data?)\n   - How aggressively to organize? (Conservative vs. comprehensive cleanup)\n\n2. **Analyze Current State**\n   \n   Review the target directory:\n   ```bash\n   # Get overview of current structure\n   ls -la [target_directory]\n   \n   # Check file types and sizes\n   find [target_directory] -type f -exec file {} \\; | head -20\n   \n   # Identify largest files\n   du -sh [target_directory]/* | sort -rh | head -20\n   \n   # Count file types\n   find [target_directory] -type f | sed 's/.*\\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn\n   ```\n   \n   Summarize findings:\n   - Total files and folders\n   - File type breakdown\n   - Size distribution\n   - Date ranges\n   - Obvious organization issues\n\n3. **Identify Organization Patterns**\n   \n   Based on the files, determine logical groupings:\n   \n   **By Type**:\n   - Documents (PDFs, DOCX, TXT)\n   - Images (JPG, PNG, SVG)\n   - Videos (MP4, MOV)\n   - Archives (ZIP, TAR, DMG)\n   - Code/Projects (directories with code)\n   - Spreadsheets (XLSX, CSV)\n   - Presentations (PPTX, KEY)\n   \n   **By Purpose**:\n   - Work vs. Personal\n   - Active vs. Archive\n   - Project-specific\n   - Reference materials\n   - Temporary/scratch files\n   \n   **By Date**:\n   - Current year/month\n   - Previous years\n   - Very old (archive candidates)\n\n4. **Find Duplicates**\n   \n   When requested, search for duplicates:\n   ```bash\n   # Find exact duplicates by hash\n   find [directory] -type f -exec md5 {} \\; | sort | uniq -d\n   \n   # Find files with same name\n   find [directory] -type f -printf '%f\\n' | sort | uniq -d\n   \n   # Find similar-sized files\n   find [directory] -type f -printf '%s %p\\n' | sort -n\n   ```\n   \n   For each set of duplicates:\n   - Show all file paths\n   - Display sizes and modification dates\n   - Recommend which to keep (usually newest or best-named)\n   - **Important**: Always ask for confirmation before deleting\n\n5. **Propose Organization Plan**\n   \n   Present a clear plan before making changes:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   # Organization Plan for [Directory]\n   \n   ## Current State\n   - X files across Y folders\n   - [Size] total\n   - File types: [breakdown]\n   - Issues: [list problems]\n   \n   ## Proposed Structure\n   \n   ```\n   [Directory]/\n   ├── Work/\n   │   ├── Projects/\n   │   ├── Documents/\n   │   └── Archive/\n   ├── Personal/\n   │   ├── Photos/\n   │   ├── Documents/\n   │   └── Media/\n   └── Downloads/\n       ├── To-Sort/\n       └── Archive/\n   ```\n   \n   ## Changes I'll Make\n   \n   1. **Create new folders**: [list]\n   2. **Move files**:\n      - X PDFs → Work/Documents/\n      - Y images → Personal/Photos/\n      - Z old files → Archive/\n   3. **Rename files**: [any renaming patterns]\n   4. **Delete**: [duplicates or trash files]\n   \n   ## Files Needing Your Decision\n   \n   - [List any files you're unsure about]\n   \n   Ready to proceed? (yes/no/modify)\n   ```\n\n6. **Execute Organization**\n   \n   After approval, organize systematically:\n   \n   ```bash\n   # Create folder structure\n   mkdir -p \"path/to/new/folders\"\n   \n   # Move files with clear logging\n   mv \"old/path/file.pdf\" \"new/path/file.pdf\"\n   \n   # Rename files with consistent patterns\n   # Example: \"YYYY-MM-DD - Description.ext\"\n   ```\n   \n   **Important Rules**:\n   - Always confirm before deleting anything\n   - Log all moves for potential undo\n   - Preserve original modification dates\n   - Handle filename conflicts gracefully\n   - Stop and ask if you encounter unexpected situations\n\n7. **Provide Summary and Maintenance Tips**\n   \n   After organizing:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   # Organization Complete! ✨\n   \n   ## What Changed\n   \n   - Created [X] new folders\n   - Organized [Y] files\n   - Freed [Z] GB by removing duplicates\n   - Archived [W] old files\n   \n   ## New Structure\n   \n   [Show the new folder tree]\n   \n   ## Maintenance Tips\n   \n   To keep this organized:\n   \n   1. **Weekly**: Sort new downloads\n   2. **Monthly**: Review and archive completed projects\n   3. **Quarterly**: Check for new duplicates\n   4. **Yearly**: Archive old files\n   \n   ## Quick Commands for You\n   \n   ```bash\n   # Find files modified this week\n   find . -type f -mtime -7\n   \n   # Sort downloads by type\n   [custom command for their setup]\n   \n   # Find duplicates\n   [custom command]\n   ```\n   \n   Want to organize another folder?\n   ```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Organizing Downloads (From Justin Dielmann)\n\n**User**: \"My Downloads folder is a mess with 500+ files. Help me organize it.\"\n\n**Process**:\n1. Analyzes Downloads folder\n2. Finds patterns: work docs, personal photos, installers, random PDFs\n3. Proposes structure:\n   - Downloads/\n     - Work/\n     - Personal/\n     - Installers/ (DMG, PKG files)\n     - Archive/\n     - ToSort/ (things needing decisions)\n4. Asks for confirmation\n5. Moves files intelligently based on content and names\n6. Results: 500 files → 5 organized folders\n\n### Example 2: Finding and Removing Duplicates\n\n**User**: \"Find duplicate files in my Documents and help me decide which to keep.\"\n\n**Output**:\n```markdown\n# Found 23 Sets of Duplicates (156 MB total)\n\n## Duplicate Set 1: \"proposal.pdf\"\n- `/Documents/proposal.pdf` (2.3 MB, modified: 2024-03-15)\n- `/Documents/old/proposal.pdf` (2.3 MB, modified: 2024-03-15)\n- `/Desktop/proposal.pdf` (2.3 MB, modified: 2024-03-10)\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep `/Documents/proposal.pdf` (most recent in correct location)\nDelete the other 2 copies?\n\n[Continue for all duplicates...]\n```\n\n### Example 3: Restructuring Projects Folder\n\n**User**: \"Review my ~/Projects directory and suggest improvements.\"\n\n**Output**:\n```markdown\n# Analysis of ~/Projects\n\n## Current Structure Issues\n- Mix of active and archived projects (3+ years old)\n- No consistent naming convention\n- Some projects at root, others in random subfolders\n- Duplicate folders (project-name, project-name-old, project-name-v2)\n\n## Proposed Structure\n\n```\nProjects/\n├── Active/\n│   ├── client-work/\n│   ├── side-projects/\n│   └── learning/\n├── Archive/\n│   ├── 2022/\n│   ├── 2023/\n│   └── 2024/\n└── Templates/\n```\n\n## Specific Changes\n1. Move 12 projects not touched since 2022 → Archive/\n2. Consolidate 4 duplicate project folders\n3. Rename projects to consistent format: \"client-name-project-name\"\n4. Create Archive for old work\n\nWant me to implement this?\n```\n\n### Example 4: Organizing Photos by Date\n\n**User**: \"Organize my photo folders by year and month.\"\n\n**Output**: Creates structure like:\n```\nPhotos/\n├── 2023/\n│   ├── 01-January/\n│   ├── 02-February/\n│   └── ...\n├── 2024/\n│   ├── 01-January/\n│   └── ...\n└── Unsorted/\n```\n\nThen moves photos based on EXIF data or file modification dates.\n\n## Common Organization Tasks\n\n### Downloads Cleanup\n```\nOrganize my Downloads folder - move documents to Documents, \nimages to Pictures, keep installers separate, and archive files \nolder than 3 months.\n```\n\n### Project Organization\n```\nReview my Projects folder structure and help me separate active \nprojects from old ones I should archive.\n```\n\n### Duplicate Removal\n```\nFind all duplicate files in my Documents folder and help me \ndecide which ones to keep.\n```\n\n### Desktop Cleanup\n```\nMy Desktop is covered in files. Help me organize everything into \nmy Documents folder properly.\n```\n\n### Photo Organization\n```\nOrganize all photos in this folder by date (year/month) based \non when they were taken.\n```\n\n### Work/Personal Separation\n```\nHelp me separate my work files from personal files across my \nDocuments folder.\n```\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n1. **Start Small**: Begin with one messy folder (like Downloads) to build trust\n2. **Regular Maintenance**: Run weekly cleanup on Downloads\n3. **Consistent Naming**: Use \"YYYY-MM-DD - Description\" format for important files\n4. **Archive Aggressively**: Move old projects to Archive instead of deleting\n5. **Keep Active Separate**: Maintain clear boundaries between active and archived work\n6. **Trust the Process**: Let Claude handle the cognitive load of where things go\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Folder Naming\n- Use clear, descriptive names\n- Avoid spaces (use hyphens or underscores)\n- Be specific: \"client-proposals\" not \"docs\"\n- Use prefixes for ordering: \"01-current\", \"02-archive\"\n\n### File Naming\n- Include dates: \"2024-10-17-meeting-notes.md\"\n- Be descriptive: \"q3-financial-report.xlsx\"\n- Avoid version numbers in names (use version control instead)\n- Remove download artifacts: \"document-final-v2 (1).pdf\" → \"document.pdf\"\n\n### When to Archive\n- Projects not touched in 6+ months\n- Completed work that might be referenced later\n- Old versions after migration to new systems\n- Files you're hesitant to delete (archive first)\n\n## Related Use Cases\n\n- Setting up organization for a new computer\n- Preparing files for backup/archiving\n- Cleaning up before storage cleanup\n- Organizing shared team folders\n- Structuring new project directories\n\n\n</skill>"}]}}

This is useful for more complex configurations or environment-specific settings.\\n\\n```text\\nmy-site/\\n├── archetypes/\\n│   └── default.md\\n├── assets/\\n├── config/           <-- site configuration\\n│   └── _default/\\n│       └── hugo.toml\\n├── content/\\n├── data/\\n├── i18n/\\n├── layouts/\\n├── static/\\n└── themes/\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Hugo Site Structure After Build\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugodocs/blob/master/content/en/getting-started/directory-structure.md\\n\\nShows the directory structure of a Hugo project after the site has been built, including the 'public' and 'resources' directories. These directories are generated by Hugo during the build process.\\n\\n```text\\nmy-site/\\n├── archetypes/\\n│   └── default.md\\n├── assets/\\n├── config/       \\n│   └── _default/\\n│       └── hugo.toml\\n├── content/\\n├── data/\\n├── i18n/\\n├── layouts/\\n├── public/       <-- created when you build your site\\n├── resources/    <-- created when you build your site\\n├── static/\\n└── themes/\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Create New Hugo Site Skeleton\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugodocs/blob/master/content/en/getting-started/directory-structure.md\\n\\nDemonstrates the command to generate a new Hugo site and the resulting default directory structure. This structure includes essential directories for content, archetypes, assets, and configuration.\\n\\n```shell\\nhugo new site my-site\\n\\nmy-site/\\n├── archetypes/\\n│   └── default.md\\n├── assets/\\n├── content/\\n├── data/\\n├── i18n/\\n├── layouts/\\n├── static/\\n├── themes/\\n└── hugo.toml         <-- site configuration\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Hugo Content Structure for Nested URLs\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugodocs/blob/master/content/en/content-management/organization/index.md\\n\\nThis text example shows a content organization that enables nested URL structures in Hugo. It illustrates how directory nesting within the 'content' folder corresponds to hierarchical URLs on the website, with 'index.md' files playing a key role.\\n\\n```txt\\n.      url\\n.    ⊢--^-⊣\\n.     path    slug\\n.    ⊢--^-⊣⊢---^---⊣\\n.        file path\\n.    ⊢------^------⊣\\ncontent/posts/happy/ness.md\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Example Hugo Branch Bundle Directory Structure\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugodocs/blob/master/content/en/content-management/page-bundles.md\\n\\nIllustrates the hierarchical organization of content within Hugo's 'content' directory, showcasing branch bundles, leaf bundles, and resources. This structure is fundamental for managing content organization and relationships in Hugo projects.\\n\\n```text\\ncontent/\\n├── branch-bundle-1/\\n│   ├── _index.md\\n│   ├── content-1.md\\n│   ├── content-2.md\\n│   ├── image-1.jpg\\n│   └── image-2.png\\n├── branch-bundle-2/\\n│   ├── a-leaf-bundle/\\n│   │   └── index.md\\n│   └── _index.md\\n└── _index.md\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Example Hugo Content Directory Structure with Page Bundles\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugodocs/blob/master/content/en/content-management/organization/index.md\\n\\nThis text-based representation illustrates a typical Hugo content directory structure that utilizes page bundles. Page bundles allow grouping related content, such as an article and its associated images, within a single directory.\\n\\n```text\\ncontent/\\n├── blog/\\n│   ├── hugo-is-cool/\\n│   │   ├── images/\\n│   │   │   ├── funnier-cat.jpg\\n│   │   │   └── funny-cat.jpg\\n│   │   ├── cats-info.md\\n│   │   └── index.md\\n│   ├── posts/\\n│   │   ├── post1.md\\n│   │   └── post2.md\\n│   ├── 1-landscape.jpg\\n│   ├── 2-sunset.jpg\\n│   ├── _index.md\\n│   ├── content-1.md\\n│   └── content-2.md\\n├── 1-logo.png\\n└── _index.md\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Configure Hugo Mounts for Union File System\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugodocs/blob/master/content/en/getting-started/directory-structure.md\\n\\nThis configuration snippet defines how Hugo mounts directories for its union file system. It allows specifying source directories and their corresponding target locations within the project, enabling content merging and overriding.\\n\\n```toml\\n[[module.mounts]]\\nsource = 'content'\\ntarget = 'content'\\n\\n[[module.mounts]]\\nsource = '/home/user/shared-content'\\ntarget = 'content'\\n```\",\"type\":\"text\"}]"}}
