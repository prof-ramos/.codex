Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Use at the start of every Claude Code session when the user provides their first prompt, and whenever the user switches to a distinctly new high-level task. Helps developers manage multiple Claude Code terminals by providing clear, at-a-glance identification of what each terminal is working on.\r\nmin_claude_code_version: \"1.0.0\"\r\nversion: \"1.1.0\"\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Terminal Title\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nAutomatically sets descriptive terminal window titles based on the task Claude is working on. Essential for developers running multiple Claude Code instances who need to quickly identify which terminal is handling which task.\r\n\r\n## When to Use\r\n\r\n**Always trigger this skill:**\r\n- At the start of every new Claude Code session (after receiving the first user prompt)\r\n- When switching to a substantially different task (e.g., from \"API Integration\" to \"Database Migration\")\r\n\r\n**Trigger on task switches like these:**\r\n- Switching from frontend work to backend work\r\n- Moving from debugging to new feature development\r\n- Changing from one module/component to a completely different one\r\n- Starting work on a different part of the system (e.g., from auth to payments)\r\n\r\n**Do NOT trigger for:**\r\n- Follow-up questions about the same task (\"Can you add a comment to that function?\")\r\n- Small refinements to current work (\"Make it blue instead of red\")\r\n- Debugging the same feature you just built\r\n- Clarifications (\"What did you mean by X?\")\r\n- Iterating on the same component or module\r\n- Mid-task status updates or progress checks\r\n\r\n## How It Works\r\n\r\n1. **Extract Task Summary**: Analyze the user's prompt to identify the high-level task\r\n2. **Generate Title**: Create a concise, descriptive title (max 40 characters)\r\n3. **Set Title**: Execute the `scripts/set_title.sh` script with the generated title\r\n4. **No Confirmation Needed**: This happens automatically in the background\r\n\r\n## Title Format Guidelines\r\n\r\n**Good titles:**\r\n- \"API Integration: Auth Flow\"\r\n- \"Fix: Login Bug\"\r\n- \"DB Migration: Users Table\"\r\n- \"Build: Dashboard UI\"\r\n- \"Refactor: Payment Module\"\r\n\r\n**Bad titles:**\r\n- Too long: \"Implementing the new authentication system with OAuth2.0 support\" (exceeds 40 chars)\r\n- Too generic: \"Working\" or \"Coding\"\r\n- Too verbose: \"The user wants me to help them with...\"\r\n\r\n**Format pattern:**\r\n```\r\n[Action/Category]: [Specific Focus]\r\n```\r\n\r\nKeep titles concise, actionable, and immediately recognizable.\r\n\r\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\r\n\r\n**❌ Too Verbose:**\r\n- Bad: \"Working on implementing the user authentication system with JWT tokens\"\r\n- Good: \"Build: JWT Auth\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Too Vague:**\r\n- Bad: \"Code stuff\"\r\n- Bad: \"Working\"\r\n- Good: \"Refactor: API Layer\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Including System Information:**\r\n- Bad: \"john-macbook-pro: Debug app\"\r\n- Bad: \"/Users/john/project: Build feature\"\r\n- Good: \"Debug: App Issues\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Using Complete Sentences:**\r\n- Bad: \"I am working on the dashboard component\"\r\n- Good: \"Build: Dashboard UI\"\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n**Execute the title script:**\r\n```bash\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Your Title Here\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# User asks: \"Help me debug the authentication flow in the API\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Debug: Auth API Flow\"\r\n\r\n# User asks: \"Create a React component for the user profile page\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Build: User Profile UI\"\r\n\r\n# User asks: \"Write tests for the payment processing module\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Test: Payment Module\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Script Details\r\n\r\nThe `scripts/set_title.sh` script uses ANSI escape sequences to set the terminal title. It's compatible with:\r\n- macOS Terminal\r\n- iTerm2\r\n- Alacritty\r\n- Most modern terminal emulators (xterm, rxvt, screen, tmux)\r\n\r\nThe script accepts a single argument (the title string) and exits silently if no title is provided (fail-safe behavior).\r\n\r\n## Optional Customization\r\n\r\nUsers can optionally customize terminal titles with a prefix by setting the `CLAUDE_TITLE_PREFIX` environment variable:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport CLAUDE_TITLE_PREFIX=\"🤖 Claude\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis produces titles like: `🤖 Claude | Build: Dashboard UI`\r\n\r\nWithout the prefix, titles remain in the standard format: `Build: Dashboard UI`\r\n\r\n**Note:** You don't need to check for this variable or modify your behavior. The script handles this automatically.\r\n"}}
