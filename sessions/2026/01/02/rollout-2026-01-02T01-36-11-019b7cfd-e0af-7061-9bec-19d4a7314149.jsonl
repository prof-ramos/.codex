This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\n# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\n**Metadata Quality:** The `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when Claude will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited*)\n\n*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nTo create a skill, follow the \"Skill Creation Process\" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAlso, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., \"To accomplish X, do Y\" rather than \"You should do X\" or \"If you need to do X\"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.\n\nTo complete SKILL.md, answer the following questions:\n\n1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?\n2. When should the skill be used?\n3. In practice, how should Claude use the skill? All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that Claude knows how to use them.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce the skill is ready, it should be packaged into a distributable zip file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a zip file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.zip`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n\n</skill>"}]}}

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).\nmetadata:\n  short-description: Install curated skills from openai/skills or other repos\n---\n\n# Skill Installer\n\nHelps install skills. By default these are from https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated, but users can also provide other locations.\n\nUse the helper scripts based on the task:\n- List curated skills when the user asks what is available, or if the user uses this skill without specifying what to do.\n- Install from the curated list when the user provides a skill name.\n- Install from another repo when the user provides a GitHub repo/path (including private repos).\n\nInstall skills with the helper scripts.\n\n## Communication\n\nWhen listing curated skills, output approximately as follows, depending on the context of the user's request:\n\"\"\"\nSkills from {repo}:\n1. skill-1\n2. skill-2 (already installed)\n3. ...\nWhich ones would you like installed?\n\"\"\"\n\nAfter installing a skill, tell the user: \"Restart Codex to pick up new skills.\"\n\n## Scripts\n\nAll of these scripts use network, so when running in the sandbox, request escalation when running them.\n\n- `scripts/list-curated-skills.py` (prints curated list with installed annotations)\n- `scripts/list-curated-skills.py --format json`\n- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --repo <owner>/<repo> --path <path/to/skill> [<path/to/skill> ...]`\n- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --url https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<ref>/<path>`\n\n## Behavior and Options\n\n- Defaults to direct download for public GitHub repos.\n- If download fails with auth/permission errors, falls back to git sparse checkout.\n- Aborts if the destination skill directory already exists.\n- Installs into `$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill-name>` (defaults to `~/.codex/skills`).\n- Multiple `--path` values install multiple skills in one run, each named from the path basename unless `--name` is supplied.\n- Options: `--ref <ref>` (default `main`), `--dest <path>`, `--method auto|download|git`.\n\n## Notes\n\n- Curated listing is fetched from `https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated` via the GitHub API. If it is unavailable, explain the error and exit.\n- Private GitHub repos can be accessed via existing git credentials or optional `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` for download.\n- Git fallback tries HTTPS first, then SSH.\n- The skills at https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.system are preinstalled, so no need to help users install those. If they ask, just explain this. If they insist, you can download and overwrite.\n- Installed annotations come from `$CODEX_HOME/skills`.\n\n</skill>"}]}}

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).\nmetadata:\n  short-description: Install curated skills from openai/skills or other repos\n---\n\n# Skill Installer\n\nHelps install skills. By default these are from https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated, but users can also provide other locations.\n\nUse the helper scripts based on the task:\n- List curated skills when the user asks what is available, or if the user uses this skill without specifying what to do.\n- Install from the curated list when the user provides a skill name.\n- Install from another repo when the user provides a GitHub repo/path (including private repos).\n\nInstall skills with the helper scripts.\n\n## Communication\n\nWhen listing curated skills, output approximately as follows, depending on the context of the user's request:\n\"\"\"\nSkills from {repo}:\n1. skill-1\n2. skill-2 (already installed)\n3. ...\nWhich ones would you like installed?\n\"\"\"\n\nAfter installing a skill, tell the user: \"Restart Codex to pick up new skills.\"\n\n## Scripts\n\nAll of these scripts use network, so when running in the sandbox, request escalation when running them.\n\n- `scripts/list-curated-skills.py` (prints curated list with installed annotations)\n- `scripts/list-curated-skills.py --format json`\n- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --repo <owner>/<repo> --path <path/to/skill> [<path/to/skill> ...]`\n- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --url https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<ref>/<path>`\n\n## Behavior and Options\n\n- Defaults to direct download for public GitHub repos.\n- If download fails with auth/permission errors, falls back to git sparse checkout.\n- Aborts if the destination skill directory already exists.\n- Installs into `$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill-name>` (defaults to `~/.codex/skills`).\n- Multiple `--path` values install multiple skills in one run, each named from the path basename unless `--name` is supplied.\n- Options: `--ref <ref>` (default `main`), `--dest <path>`, `--method auto|download|git`.\n\n## Notes\n\n- Curated listing is fetched from `https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated` via the GitHub API. If it is unavailable, explain the error and exit.\n- Private GitHub repos can be accessed via existing git credentials or optional `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` for download.\n- Git fallback tries HTTPS first, then SSH.\n- The skills at https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.system are preinstalled, so no need to help users install those. If they ask, just explain this. If they insist, you can download and overwrite.\n- Installed annotations come from `$CODEX_HOME/skills`.\n\n</skill>"}]}}

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).\nmetadata:\n  short-description: Install curated skills from openai/skills or other repos\n---\n\n# Skill Installer\n\nHelps install skills. By default these are from https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated, but users can also provide other locations.\n\nUse the helper scripts based on the task:\n- List curated skills when the user asks what is available, or if the user uses this skill without specifying what to do.\n- Install from the curated list when the user provides a skill name.\n- Install from another repo when the user provides a GitHub repo/path (including private repos).\n\nInstall skills with the helper scripts.\n\n## Communication\n\nWhen listing curated skills, output approximately as follows, depending on the context of the user's request:\n\"\"\"\nSkills from {repo}:\n1. skill-1\n2. skill-2 (already installed)\n3. ...\nWhich ones would you like installed?\n\"\"\"\n\nAfter installing a skill, tell the user: \"Restart Codex to pick up new skills.\"\n\n## Scripts\n\nAll of these scripts use network, so when running in the sandbox, request escalation when running them.\n\n- `scripts/list-curated-skills.py` (prints curated list with installed annotations)\n- `scripts/list-curated-skills.py --format json`\n- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --repo <owner>/<repo> --path <path/to/skill> [<path/to/skill> ...]`\n- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --url https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<ref>/<path>`\n\n## Behavior and Options\n\n- Defaults to direct download for public GitHub repos.\n- If download fails with auth/permission errors, falls back to git sparse checkout.\n- Aborts if the destination skill directory already exists.\n- Installs into `$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill-name>` (defaults to `~/.codex/skills`).\n- Multiple `--path` values install multiple skills in one run, each named from the path basename unless `--name` is supplied.\n- Options: `--ref <ref>` (default `main`), `--dest <path>`, `--method auto|download|git`.\n\n## Notes\n\n- Curated listing is fetched from `https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated` via the GitHub API. If it is unavailable, explain the error and exit.\n- Private GitHub repos can be accessed via existing git credentials or optional `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` for download.\n- Git fallback tries HTTPS first, then SSH.\n- The skills at https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.system are preinstalled, so no need to help users install those. If they ask, just explain this. If they insist, you can download and overwrite.\n- Installed annotations come from `$CODEX_HOME/skills`.\n\n</skill>"}]}}

Introducing Agent Skills, a new way to build specialized agents using files and folders.\n\nUpdate: We've published Agent Skills as an open standard for cross-platform portability. (December 18, 2025)\n\nAs model capabilities improve, we can now build general-purpose agents that interact with full-fledged computing environments. Claude Code, for example, can accomplish complex tasks across domains using local code execution and filesystems. But as these agents become more powerful, we need more composable, scalable, and portable ways to equip them with domain-specific expertise.\n\nThis led us to create Agent Skills: organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and load dynamically to perform better at specific tasks. Skills extend Claude’s capabilities by packaging your expertise into composable resources for Claude, transforming general-purpose agents into specialized agents that fit your needs.\n\nBuilding a skill for an agent is like putting together an onboarding guide for a new hire. Instead of building fragmented, custom-designed agents for each use case, anyone can now specialize their agents with composable capabilities by capturing and sharing their procedural knowledge. In this article, we explain what Skills are, show how they work, and share best practices for building your own.\n\nTo activate skills, all you need to do is write a SKILL.md file with custom guidance for your agent.\nA skill is a directory containing a SKILL.md file that contains organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that give agents additional capabilities.\nThe anatomy of a skill\nTo see Skills in action, let’s walk through a real example: one of the skills that powers Claude’s recently launched document editing abilities. Claude already knows a lot about understanding PDFs, but is limited in its ability to manipulate them directly (e.g. to fill out a form). This PDF skill lets us give Claude these new abilities.\n\nAt its simplest, a skill is a directory that contains a SKILL.md file. This file must start with YAML frontmatter that contains some required metadata: name and description. At startup, the agent pre-loads the name and description of every installed skill into its system prompt.\n\nThis metadata is the first level of progressive disclosure: it provides just enough information for Claude to know when each skill should be used without loading all of it into context. The actual body of this file is the second level of detail. If Claude thinks the skill is relevant to the current task, it will load the skill by reading its full SKILL.md into context.\n\nAnatomy of a SKILL.md file including the relevant metadata: name, description, and context related to the specific actions the skill should take.\nA SKILL.md file must begin with YAML Frontmatter that contains a file name and description, which is loaded into its system prompt at startup.\nAs skills grow in complexity, they may contain too much context to fit into a single SKILL.md, or context that’s relevant only in specific scenarios. In these cases, skills can bundle additional files within the skill directory and reference them by name from SKILL.md. These additional linked files are the third level (and beyond) of detail, which Claude can choose to navigate and discover only as needed.\n\nIn the PDF skill shown below, the SKILL.md refers to two additional files (reference.md and forms.md) that the skill author chooses to bundle alongside the core SKILL.md. By moving the form-filling instructions to a separate file (forms.md), the skill author is able to keep the core of the skill lean, trusting that Claude will read forms.md only when filling out a form.\n\nHow to bundle additional content into a SKILL.md file.\nYou can incorporate more context (via additional files) into your skill that can then be triggered by Claude based on the system prompt.\nProgressive disclosure is the core design principle that makes Agent Skills flexible and scalable. Like a well-organized manual that starts with a table of contents, then specific chapters, and finally a detailed appendix, skills let Claude load information only as needed:\n\nThis image depicts how progressive disclosure of context in Skills.\nAgents with a filesystem and code execution tools don’t need to read the entirety of a skill into their context window when working on a particular task. This means that the amount of context that can be bundled into a skill is effectively unbounded.\n\nSkills and the context window\nThe following diagram shows how the context window changes when a skill is triggered by a user’s message.\n\nThis image depicts how skills are triggered in your context window.\nSkills are triggered in the context window via your system prompt.\nThe sequence of operations shown:\n\nTo start, the context window has the core system prompt and the metadata for each of the installed skills, along with the user’s initial message;\nClaude triggers the PDF skill by invoking a Bash tool to read the contents of pdf/SKILL.md;\nClaude chooses to read the forms.md file bundled with the skill;\nFinally, Claude proceeds with the user’s task now that it has loaded relevant instructions from the PDF skill.\nSkills and code execution\nSkills can also include code for Claude to execute as tools at its discretion.\n\nLarge language models excel at many tasks, but certain operations are better suited for traditional code execution. For example, sorting a list via token generation is far more expensive than simply running a sorting algorithm. Beyond efficiency concerns, many applications require the deterministic reliability that only code can provide.\n\nIn our example, the PDF skill includes a pre-written Python script that reads a PDF and extracts all form fields. Claude can run this script without loading either the script or the PDF into context. And because code is deterministic, this workflow is consistent and repeatable.\n\nThis image depicts how code is executed via Skills.\nSkills can also include code for Claude to execute as tools at its discretion based on the nature of the task.\nDeveloping and evaluating skills\nHere are some helpful guidelines for getting started with authoring and testing skills:\n\nStart with evaluation: Identify specific gaps in your agents’ capabilities by running them on representative tasks and observing where they struggle or require additional context. Then build skills incrementally to address these shortcomings.\nStructure for scale: When the SKILL.md file becomes unwieldy, split its content into separate files and reference them. If certain contexts are mutually exclusive or rarely used together, keeping the paths separate will reduce the token usage. Finally, code can serve as both executable tools and as documentation. It should be clear whether Claude should run scripts directly or read them into context as reference.\nThink from Claude’s perspective: Monitor how Claude uses your skill in real scenarios and iterate based on observations: watch for unexpected trajectories or overreliance on certain contexts. Pay special attention to the name and description of your skill. Claude will use these when deciding whether to trigger the skill in response to its current task.\nIterate with Claude: As you work on a task with Claude, ask Claude to capture its successful approaches and common mistakes into reusable context and code within a skill. If it goes off track when using a skill to complete a task, ask it to self-reflect on what went wrong. This process will help you discover what context Claude actually needs, instead of trying to anticipate it upfront.\nSecurity considerations when using Skills\nSkills provide Claude with new capabilities through instructions and code. While this makes them powerful, it also means that malicious skills may introduce vulnerabilities in the environment where they’re used or direct Claude to exfiltrate data and take unintended actions.\n\nWe recommend installing skills only from trusted sources. When installing a skill from a less-trusted source, thoroughly audit it before use. Start by reading the contents of the files bundled in the skill to understand what it does, paying particular attention to code dependencies and bundled resources like images or scripts. Similarly, pay attention to instructions or code within the skill that instruct Claude to connect to potentially untrusted external network sources.\n\nThe future of Skills\nAgent Skills are supported today across Claude.ai, Claude Code, the Claude Agent SDK, and the Claude Developer Platform.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we’ll continue to add features that support the full lifecycle of creating, editing, discovering, sharing, and using Skills. We’re especially excited about the opportunity for Skills to help organizations and individuals share their context and workflows with Claude. We’ll also explore how Skills can complement Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers by teaching agents more complex workflows that involve external tools and software.\n\nLooking further ahead, we hope to enable agents to create, edit, and evaluate Skills on their own, letting them codify their own patterns of behavior into reusable capabilities.\n\nSkills are a simple concept with a correspondingly simple format. This simplicity makes it easier for organizations, developers, and end users to build customized agents and give them new capabilities.\n\nWe’re excited to see what people build with Skills. Get started today by checking out our Skills docs and cookbook.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWritten by Barry Zhang, Keith Lazuka, and Mahesh Murag, who all really like folders.

But as these agents become more powerful, we need more composable, scalable, and portable ways to equip them with domain-specific expertise.\n\nThis led us to create Agent Skills: organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and load dynamically to perform better at specific tasks. Skills extend Claude’s capabilities by packaging your expertise into composable resources for Claude, transforming general-purpose agents into specialized agents that fit your needs.\n\nBuilding a skill for an agent is like putting together an onboarding guide for a new hire. Instead of building fragmented, custom-designed agents for each use case, anyone can now specialize their agents with composable capabilities by capturing and sharing their procedural knowledge. In this article, we explain what Skills are, show how they work, and share best practices for building your own.\n\nTo activate skills, all you need to do is write a SKILL.md file with custom guidance for your agent.\nA skill is a directory containing a SKILL.md file that contains organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that give agents additional capabilities.\nThe anatomy of a skill\nTo see Skills in action, let’s walk through a real example: one of the skills that powers Claude’s recently launched document editing abilities. Claude already knows a lot about understanding PDFs, but is limited in its ability to manipulate them directly (e.g. to fill out a form). This PDF skill lets us give Claude these new abilities.\n\nAt its simplest, a skill is a directory that contains a SKILL.md file. This file must start with YAML frontmatter that contains some required metadata: name and description. At startup, the agent pre-loads the name and description of every installed skill into its system prompt.\n\nThis metadata is the first level of progressive disclosure: it provides just enough information for Claude to know when each skill should be used without loading all of it into context. The actual body of this file is the second level of detail. If Claude thinks the skill is relevant to the current task, it will load the skill by reading its full SKILL.md into context.\n\nAnatomy of a SKILL.md file including the relevant metadata: name, description, and context related to the specific actions the skill should take.\nA SKILL.md file must begin with YAML Frontmatter that contains a file name and description, which is loaded into its system prompt at startup.\nAs skills grow in complexity, they may contain too much context to fit into a single SKILL.md, or context that’s relevant only in specific scenarios. In these cases, skills can bundle additional files within the skill directory and reference them by name from SKILL.md. These additional linked files are the third level (and beyond) of detail, which Claude can choose to navigate and discover only as needed.\n\nIn the PDF skill shown below, the SKILL.md refers to two additional files (reference.md and forms.md) that the skill author chooses to bundle alongside the core SKILL.md. By moving the form-filling instructions to a separate file (forms.md), the skill author is able to keep the core of the skill lean, trusting that Claude will read forms.md only when filling out a form.\n\nHow to bundle additional content into a SKILL.md file.\nYou can incorporate more context (via additional files) into your skill that can then be triggered by Claude based on the system prompt.\nProgressive disclosure is the core design principle that makes Agent Skills flexible and scalable. Like a well-organized manual that starts with a table of contents, then specific chapters, and finally a detailed appendix, skills let Claude load information only as needed:\n\nThis image depicts how progressive disclosure of context in Skills.\nAgents with a filesystem and code execution tools don’t need to read the entirety of a skill into their context window when working on a particular task. This means that the amount of context that can be bundled into a skill is effectively unbounded.\n\nSkills and the context window\nThe following diagram shows how the context window changes when a skill is triggered by a user’s message.\n\nThis image depicts how skills are triggered in your context window.\nSkills are triggered in the context window via your system prompt.\nThe sequence of operations shown:\n\nTo start, the context window has the core system prompt and the metadata for each of the installed skills, along with the user’s initial message;\nClaude triggers the PDF skill by invoking a Bash tool to read the contents of pdf/SKILL.md;\nClaude chooses to read the forms.md file bundled with the skill;\nFinally, Claude proceeds with the user’s task now that it has loaded relevant instructions from the PDF skill.\nSkills and code execution\nSkills can also include code for Claude to execute as tools at its discretion.\n\nLarge language models excel at many tasks, but certain operations are better suited for traditional code execution. For example, sorting a list via token generation is far more expensive than simply running a sorting algorithm. Beyond efficiency concerns, many applications require the deterministic reliability that only code can provide.\n\nIn our example, the PDF skill includes a pre-written Python script that reads a PDF and extracts all form fields. Claude can run this script without loading either the script or the PDF into context. And because code is deterministic, this workflow is consistent and repeatable.\n\nThis image depicts how code is executed via Skills.\nSkills can also include code for Claude to execute as tools at its discretion based on the nature of the task.\nDeveloping and evaluating skills\nHere are some helpful guidelines for getting started with authoring and testing skills:\n\nStart with evaluation: Identify specific gaps in your agents’ capabilities by running them on representative tasks and observing where they struggle or require additional context. Then build skills incrementally to address these shortcomings.\nStructure for scale: When the SKILL.md file becomes unwieldy, split its content into separate files and reference them. If certain contexts are mutually exclusive or rarely used together, keeping the paths separate will reduce the token usage. Finally, code can serve as both executable tools and as documentation. It should be clear whether Claude should run scripts directly or read them into context as reference.\nThink from Claude’s perspective: Monitor how Claude uses your skill in real scenarios and iterate based on observations: watch for unexpected trajectories or overreliance on certain contexts. Pay special attention to the name and description of your skill. Claude will use these when deciding whether to trigger the skill in response to its current task.\nIterate with Claude: As you work on a task with Claude, ask Claude to capture its successful approaches and common mistakes into reusable context and code within a skill. If it goes off track when using a skill to complete a task, ask it to self-reflect on what went wrong. This process will help you discover what context Claude actually needs, instead of trying to anticipate it upfront.\nSecurity considerations when using Skills\nSkills provide Claude with new capabilities through instructions and code. While this makes them powerful, it also means that malicious skills may introduce vulnerabilities in the environment where they’re used or direct Claude to exfiltrate data and take unintended actions.\n\nWe recommend installing skills only from trusted sources. When installing a skill from a less-trusted source, thoroughly audit it before use. Start by reading the contents of the files bundled in the skill to understand what it does, paying particular attention to code dependencies and bundled resources like images or scripts. Similarly, pay attention to instructions or code within the skill that instruct Claude to connect to potentially untrusted external network sources.\n\nThe future of Skills\nAgent Skills are supported today across Claude.ai, Claude Code, the Claude Agent SDK, and the Claude Developer Platform.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we’ll continue to add features that support the full lifecycle of creating, editing, discovering, sharing, and using Skills. We’re especially excited about the opportunity for Skills to help organizations and individuals share their context and workflows with Claude. We’ll also explore how Skills can complement Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers by teaching agents more complex workflows that involve external tools and software.\n\nLooking further ahead, we hope to enable agents to create, edit, and evaluate Skills on their own, letting them codify their own patterns of behavior into reusable capabilities.\n\nSkills are a simple concept with a correspondingly simple format. This simplicity makes it easier for organizations, developers, and end users to build customized agents and give them new capabilities.\n\nWe’re excited to see what people build with Skills. Get started today by checking out our Skills docs and cookbook.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWritten by Barry Zhang, Keith Lazuka, and Mahesh Murag, who all really like folders.

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\n# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\n**Metadata Quality:** The `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when Claude will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited*)\n\n*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nTo create a skill, follow the \"Skill Creation Process\" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAlso, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., \"To accomplish X, do Y\" rather than \"You should do X\" or \"If you need to do X\"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.\n\nTo complete SKILL.md, answer the following questions:\n\n1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?\n2. When should the skill be used?\n3. In practice, how should Claude use the skill? All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that Claude knows how to use them.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce the skill is ready, it should be packaged into a distributable zip file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a zip file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.zip`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n\n</skill>"}]}}
