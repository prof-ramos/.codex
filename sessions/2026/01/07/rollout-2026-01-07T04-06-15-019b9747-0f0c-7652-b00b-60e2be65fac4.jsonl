Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"fe767c9bc02c54001bf64792124dac95c344ed61","branch":"main","repository_url":"https://github.com/prof-ramos/asof_gemini.git"}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use at the start of every Claude Code session when the user provides their first prompt, and whenever the user switches to a distinctly new high-level task. Helps developers manage multiple Claude Code terminals by providing clear, at-a-glance identification of what each terminal is working on.\r\nmin_claude_code_version: \"1.0.0\"\r\nversion: \"1.1.0\"\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Terminal Title\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nAutomatically sets descriptive terminal window titles based on the task Claude is working on. Essential for developers running multiple Claude Code instances who need to quickly identify which terminal is handling which task.\r\n\r\n## When to Use\r\n\r\n**Always trigger this skill:**\r\n- At the start of every new Claude Code session (after receiving the first user prompt)\r\n- When switching to a substantially different task (e.g., from \"API Integration\" to \"Database Migration\")\r\n\r\n**Trigger on task switches like these:**\r\n- Switching from frontend work to backend work\r\n- Moving from debugging to new feature development\r\n- Changing from one module/component to a completely different one\r\n- Starting work on a different part of the system (e.g., from auth to payments)\r\n\r\n**Do NOT trigger for:**\r\n- Follow-up questions about the same task (\"Can you add a comment to that function?\")\r\n- Small refinements to current work (\"Make it blue instead of red\")\r\n- Debugging the same feature you just built\r\n- Clarifications (\"What did you mean by X?\")\r\n- Iterating on the same component or module\r\n- Mid-task status updates or progress checks\r\n\r\n## How It Works\r\n\r\n1. **Extract Task Summary**: Analyze the user's prompt to identify the high-level task\r\n2. **Generate Title**: Create a concise, descriptive title (max 40 characters)\r\n3. **Set Title**: Execute the `scripts/set_title.sh` script with the generated title\r\n4. **No Confirmation Needed**: This happens automatically in the background\r\n\r\n## Title Format Guidelines\r\n\r\n**Good titles:**\r\n- \"API Integration: Auth Flow\"\r\n- \"Fix: Login Bug\"\r\n- \"DB Migration: Users Table\"\r\n- \"Build: Dashboard UI\"\r\n- \"Refactor: Payment Module\"\r\n\r\n**Bad titles:**\r\n- Too long: \"Implementing the new authentication system with OAuth2.0 support\" (exceeds 40 chars)\r\n- Too generic: \"Working\" or \"Coding\"\r\n- Too verbose: \"The user wants me to help them with...\"\r\n\r\n**Format pattern:**\r\n```\r\n[Action/Category]: [Specific Focus]\r\n```\r\n\r\nKeep titles concise, actionable, and immediately recognizable.\r\n\r\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\r\n\r\n**❌ Too Verbose:**\r\n- Bad: \"Working on implementing the user authentication system with JWT tokens\"\r\n- Good: \"Build: JWT Auth\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Too Vague:**\r\n- Bad: \"Code stuff\"\r\n- Bad: \"Working\"\r\n- Good: \"Refactor: API Layer\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Including System Information:**\r\n- Bad: \"john-macbook-pro: Debug app\"\r\n- Bad: \"/Users/john/project: Build feature\"\r\n- Good: \"Debug: App Issues\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Using Complete Sentences:**\r\n- Bad: \"I am working on the dashboard component\"\r\n- Good: \"Build: Dashboard UI\"\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n**Execute the title script:**\r\n```bash\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Your Title Here\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# User asks: \"Help me debug the authentication flow in the API\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Debug: Auth API Flow\"\r\n\r\n# User asks: \"Create a React component for the user profile page\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Build: User Profile UI\"\r\n\r\n# User asks: \"Write tests for the payment processing module\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Test: Payment Module\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Script Details\r\n\r\nThe `scripts/set_title.sh` script uses ANSI escape sequences to set the terminal title. It's compatible with:\r\n- macOS Terminal\r\n- iTerm2\r\n- Alacritty\r\n- Most modern terminal emulators (xterm, rxvt, screen, tmux)\r\n\r\nThe script accepts a single argument (the title string) and exits silently if no title is provided (fail-safe behavior).\r\n\r\n## Optional Customization\r\n\r\nUsers can optionally customize terminal titles with a prefix by setting the `CLAUDE_TITLE_PREFIX` environment variable:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport CLAUDE_TITLE_PREFIX=\"🤖 Claude\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis produces titles like: `🤖 Claude | Build: Dashboard UI`\r\n\r\nWithout the prefix, titles remain in the standard format: `Build: Dashboard UI`\r\n\r\n**Note:** You don't need to check for this variable or modify your behavior. The script handles this automatically.\r\n"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Avoid committing secrets or generated binaries.\r\n\r\n## Security & Configuration Tips\r\n- Never commit `.env*` files or database dumps; populate `.env.local` with local credentials only.\r\n- Review `PRISMA_SETUP.md` before altering the schema; regenerate client (`npm run db:generate`) after schema edits.\r\n- Validate redirects and robots rules when touching `app/sitemap.ts` or `app/robots.ts` to avoid leaking drafts.\r\n"}}

(file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Uso: fundos sólidos, header colapsado, títulos, botões principais.\r\n- Acento: `#82b4d6` (principal) / `#a0c8e4` (clara). Uso: destaques, CTAs secundárias, hovers, traços decorativos.\r\n- Neutro: `#e7edf4`. Uso: fundos suaves de seções (ex.: `PillarsSection`), bullets e ícones de suporte.\r\n- Complementos de interface: `text-slate-…` para texto de apoio e `border-slate-…` para divisórias discretas.\r\n- Seleção de texto: fundo `accent` com texto `primary`.\r\n- Gradientes: CTA usa `bg-gradient-to-r from-primary-dark to-accent`. Hero overlay combina `bg-primary/70` + `bg-gradient-to-t from-primary/90 via-transparent`.\r\n\r\n## Tipografia\r\n\r\n- Fontes (Next Font):\r\n  - Títulos/decorativa: `Playfair Display` (variável `--font-playfair`, pesos 400/600/700, normal/itálico).\r\n  - Texto/base: `Inter` (variável `--font-inter`, pesos 300/400/500/600).\r\n- Uso:\r\n  - Títulos, destaques e números-chave: `font-serif`.\r\n  - Corpo, navegação, legendas e botões: `font-sans`.\r\n  - Navegação e selos: uppercase com `tracking-[0.2em]` ou `tracking-widest`.\r\n- Escala tipográfica (Tailwind extend):\r\n  - Formato: `nome tamanho/line-height` (ex: `xs 12/1.2` = 12px com line-height 1.2)\r\n  - `xs`: 12px / line-height 1.2\r\n  - `sm`: 14px / line-height 1.4\r\n  - `base`: 16px / line-height 1.5\r\n  - `lg`: 18px / line-height 1.5\r\n  - `xl`: 20px / line-height 1.6\r\n  - `2xl`: 24px / line-height 1.6\r\n  - `3xl`: 30px / line-height 1.5\r\n  - `4xl`: 36px / line-height 1.4\r\n  - `5xl`: 48px / line-height 1.3\r\n  - `6xl`: 60px / line-height 1.2\r\n  - `7xl`: 72px / line-height 1.1\r\n- Comprimento ideal de linha: `65ch` (`max-w-prose`).\r\n\r\n## Layout, grid e espaçamento\r\n\r\n- Grid (referência em `lib/design-tokens.ts`): 4 colunas mobile, 8 tablet, 12 desktop; gutter 16px; margem 24px.\r\n- Espaçamento: sistema 8pt (`4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 96`). Seções padrão `py-24`.\r\n- Container: `container mx-auto px-6`; em seções hero, usar `text-center` com limitação de largura (`max-w-2xl/3xl` conforme o bloco).\r\n- Cards e grids: gaps de 16–24px em listas (`gap-8` recorrente).\r\n- Z-index tokens: `base 0`, `dropdown 10`, `sticky 20`, `header 50`, `overlay 90`, `modal 100`.\r\n\r\n## Componentes principais\r\n\r\n- Header fixo:\r\n  - Estados: topo `bg-primary/80` com texto claro; scrolled `bg-white/95` com `shadow-sm`.\r\n  - Navegação desktop uppercase, tracking largo; dropdowns com `border` leve e `shadow-lg`.\r\n  - Logo SVG 32px + tipografia serifada.\r\n- Botões (`components/ui/Button.tsx`):\r\n  - Variantes: `primary` (bg primary, texto branco), `outline` (borda primary), `highlight` (bg acento, peso forte), `ghost` (bg branco/borda slate).\r\n  - Tamanhos: `sm 48px`, `md 50px`, `lg 52px` de altura fixa; paddings `px-8/10/12`; sempre uppercase, `tracking-wide`, `font-medium`.\r\n  - Motion: hover scale 1.05, tap 0.95 (omitido em `prefers-reduced-motion`).\r\n- Badges: uppercase `text-sm`, `font-bold`, `rounded-sm`; variante padrão `bg-white/90 text-primary`, variante acento `bg-accent text-primary`.\r\n- Cards:\r\n  - Base (`Card`): `bg-white`, `p-6`, `shadow-sm` → hover `shadow-md`.\r\n  - IconCard: `p-8`, borda superior colorida no hover (`accent`), ícone em disco `bg-neutral` → `bg-accent` no hover; tilt 3D suave (desligado em RMO).\r\n  - NewsCard: imagem `aspect-[4/3]` com `rounded-sm`, `grayscale-[0.2]`, zoom no hover; time uppercase, título serif, linha animada no rodapé; tilt/houver lift sutil.\r\n- Seções:\r\n  - Hero: altura tela inteira, imagem com overlays, badge translucente, títulos serif itálico no acento, botões duplos (`highlight` + `outline` branco).\r\n  - About: layout 50/50, imagem `grayscale` com hover para cor, bloco de contagem em `primary-dark`.\r\n  - Pillars: fundo `neutral` com `border-y border-blue-200/50`, cards em grid 3 colunas desktop.\r\n  - CTA: gradiente primário→acento, grid decorativo em SVG com opacidade baixa, botão `ghost` com borda 2px.\r\n- Footer: fundo `primary`, texto `neutral/70`, divisórias `border-primary-dark`, ícones circulares `primary-dark` → `accent` no hover; inputs de newsletter com foco `ring-accent`.\r\n\r\n## Ícones e imagens\r\n\r\n- Biblioteca: `lucide-react`; tamanhos orientados por tokens (`xs 16` até `2xl 36`). Em cards, ícones 24–28px.\r\n- Imagens: `next/image` com foco em arquitetura institucional/Itamaraty; overlays de cor para manter contraste; uso de `grayscale` parcial para coerência com a paleta.\r\n- Ilustrações decorativas: padrões de grade em CTA (stroke branco opaco).\r\n\r\n## Motion e interações\r\n\r\n- Variáveis globais (`app/globals.css`): easings `--ease-elegant`, `--ease-smooth`, etc.; durações 0–1200ms; translations Y `10/20/40px`; opacidades sutis.\r\n- Framer Motion centralizado (`lib/motion-config.ts` e `lib/motion-variants.ts`):\r\n  - Easing principal: `[0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]` (elegant); tempos: fast 150ms, normal 400ms, slow 600ms, elegant 800ms, verySlow 1200ms.\r\n  - Variantes prontas: `fadeIn`, `fadeInUp/Down/Left/Right`, `scaleIn`, `staggerContainer`, `hoverLift/Scale/Glow`, `hero*` (badge/title/description/buttons), `iconFloat`, `pulseSubtle`.\r\n  - Scroll reveal padrão: `viewport amount 0.2, once true` (ou repetição opcional).\r\n  - Redução de movimento: se `prefers-reduced-motion`, animações são omitidas e efeitos de tilt/scale removidos.\r\n- Microinterações: hover de botões/links aumenta escala ou cor; cards sobem `y` negativo pequeno; underline expansível em links (`underlineExpand`).\r\n\r\n## Acessibilidade\r\n\r\n- Contraste alvo (WCAG 2.1): textos normais ≥4.5:1, grandes ≥3:1 (tokens `WCAG_CONTRAST`).\r\n- Tamanhos de toque: botões ≥48px de altura; espaçamento recomendado entre botões 16–24px.\r\n- Navegação via teclado: estados `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary focus:ring-offset-2` em botões; inputs com `focus:ring-accent`.\r\n- Suporte a `prefers-reduced-motion` em animações e tilts 3D.\r\n\r\n## Formulários e campos\r\n\r\n- Inputs (newsletter): `bg-primary-dark`, texto branco, `px-4 py-2`, `rounded-l-sm`, placeholder `neutral/50`; botão acoplado `bg-accent text-primary` com hover `accent/90`.\r\n- Labels ocultos via `sr-only` quando necessário.\r\n\r\n## Uso de textos e capitalização\r\n\r\n- Navegação, badges e datas: uppercase com tracking amplo.\r\n- Títulos e headings: serifados, peso médio/semibold, `leading-tight`.\r\n- Corpo: `font-light` a `font-regular`, `leading-relaxed` ou `leading-relaxed/loose` para trechos longos.\r\n\r\n## Divisórias, bordas e sombras\r\n\r\n- Bordas leves: `border-slate-200/300` em dropdowns, cartões e inputs.\r\n- Sombras: `shadow-sm` padrão; `shadow-md`/`shadow-lg` em hovers ou elementos suspensos (dropdowns, hero overlays).\r\n\r\n## Boas práticas de composição\r\n\r\n- Combinar `primary` com `accent` para CTAs; reservar `neutral` para respiro entre blocos.\r\n- Manter grids simétricos (gaps 16–24px) e limites de largura (`max-w-2xl/3xl`) para textos longos.\r\n- Preservar consistência de borda `rounded-sm` e tipografia serifada em títulos para manter identidade.\r\n\r\n## Diretrizes para redes sociais e e-mail\r\n\r\n- Identidade e tom\r\n  - Tom: institucional, claro, direto; evitar jargões; voz ativa.\r\n  - Títulos/headers: `Playfair Display`; corpo e botões: `Inter`.\r\n  - Hierarquia: título serif (600/700), subtítulo sans (500), corpo sans (400).\r\n- Cores e fundos\r\n  - Fundos preferenciais: `#040920` (primary) ou `#e7edf4` (neutral) para contraste com texto; `accent` em bordas/CTA.\r\n  - Gradiente permitido: `from-primary-dark to-accent` para capas e banners.\r\n  - Fotos: aplicar overlay `primary/70` ou `primary/80` para legibilidade de texto.\r\n- Logos e segurança de marca\r\n  - Avatares: logo em branco sobre fundo `primary` ou logo `primary` sobre fundo claro; margem interna 10–15%.\r\n  - Não distorcer, não usar sombras pesadas; manter cantos `rounded-sm`.\r\n- Formatos e dimensões (exportar em 2x quando possível)\r\n  - Instagram feed: 1080x1080 (quadrado) ou 1080x1350 (retrato); stories: 1080x1920 com área segura (160px topo/rodapé, 120px laterais).\r\n  - Twitter/X: post 1600x900; header 1500x500 (conteúdo seguro 1120x360).\r\n  - LinkedIn: post 1200x1200; capa página 1128x191; capa perfil 1584x396.\r\n  - E-mail banners: largura 600–640px; manter textos-chave em HTML (não embedar tudo na imagem).\r\n- Tipografia e textos em arte\r\n  - Tamanho mínimo: corpo 32px em peças mobile; títulos ≥44px; contraste mínimo AA.\r\n  - Uppercase apenas para selos/datas; evitar blocos longos em caps.\r\n  - Tracking aberto em selos/CTA (`tracking-[0.2em]` ou `tracking-widest`).\r\n- CTAs e botões visuais\r\n  - Botões: `primary` ou `accent` com texto branco/primary; altura visual ~50px; `rounded-sm`; sombra leve ou stroke fino.\r\n  - CTA textual: verbo no infinitivo (“Acesse”, “Leia”, “Inscreva-se”); link clicável em e-mail/post.\r\n- Imagens e ícones\r\n  - Imagens institucionais (Itamaraty/consular); se conflitar com paleta, aplicar `grayscale` 20–30% e overlay.\r\n  - Ícones `lucide` 24–32px; cor `accent` ou branco em fundos escuros.\r\n- Acessibilidade e legibilidade\r\n  - Alt text/legendas sempre que possível; contraste ≥4.5:1.\r\n  - Respeitar áreas de corte/previews (headers e thumbs); manter conteúdo crítico na área segura.\r\n- Hashtags e rodapé\r\n  - 2–5 hashtags relevantes; evitar lista longa.\r\n  - Assinatura curta para anúncios: “ASOF — Oficiais de Chancelaria”.\r\n- E-mail (HTML)\r\n  - Largura 600–640px; fundo `neutral` ou branco; títulos serif, corpo sans; line-height 1.5.\r\n  - Botões: `bg-primary text-white`, padding 16–20px, altura mínima 48px, largura mínima 180px, `rounded-sm`, hover mais escuro ou `accent`.\r\n  - Links: cor `accent` com sublinhado em hover;

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
