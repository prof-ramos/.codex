Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"a95dea9390b51afedbe6105f3a1da62d7dd01f2c","branch":"main","repository_url":"https://github.com/prof-ramos/tdl-mcp.git"}}}

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Use when building MCP servers to integrate external APIs or services, whether in Python (FastMCP) or Node/TypeScript (MCP SDK).\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\n# MCP Server Development Guide\n\n## Overview\n\nTo create high-quality MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that enable LLMs to effectively interact with external services, use this skill. An MCP server provides tools that allow LLMs to access external services and APIs. The quality of an MCP server is measured by how well it enables LLMs to accomplish real-world tasks using the tools provided.\n\n---\n\n# Process\n\n## 🚀 High-Level Workflow\n\nCreating a high-quality MCP server involves four main phases:\n\n### Phase 1: Deep Research and Planning\n\n#### 1.1 Understand Agent-Centric Design Principles\n\nBefore diving into implementation, understand how to design tools for AI agents by reviewing these principles:\n\n**Build for Workflows, Not Just API Endpoints:**\n- Don't simply wrap existing API endpoints - build thoughtful, high-impact workflow tools\n- Consolidate related operations (e.g., `schedule_event` that both checks availability and creates event)\n- Focus on tools that enable complete tasks, not just individual API calls\n- Consider what workflows agents actually need to accomplish\n\n**Optimize for Limited Context:**\n- Agents have constrained context windows - make every token count\n- Return high-signal information, not exhaustive data dumps\n- Provide \"concise\" vs \"detailed\" response format options\n- Default to human-readable identifiers over technical codes (names over IDs)\n- Consider the agent's context budget as a scarce resource\n\n**Design Actionable Error Messages:**\n- Error messages should guide agents toward correct usage patterns\n- Suggest specific next steps: \"Try using filter='active_only' to reduce results\"\n- Make errors educational, not just diagnostic\n- Help agents learn proper tool usage through clear feedback\n\n**Follow Natural Task Subdivisions:**\n- Tool names should reflect how humans think about tasks\n- Group related tools with consistent prefixes for discoverability\n- Design tools around natural workflows, not just API structure\n\n**Use Evaluation-Driven Development:**\n- Create realistic evaluation scenarios early\n- Let agent feedback drive tool improvements\n- Prototype quickly and iterate based on actual agent performance\n\n#### 1.3 Study MCP Protocol Documentation\n\n**Fetch the latest MCP protocol documentation:**\n\nUse WebFetch to load: `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt`\n\nThis comprehensive document contains the complete MCP specification and guidelines.\n\n#### 1.4 Study Framework Documentation\n\n**Load and read the following reference files:**\n\n- **MCP Best Practices**: [📋 View Best Practices](./reference/mcp_best_practices.md) - Core guidelines for all MCP servers\n\n**For Python implementations, also load:**\n- **Python SDK Documentation**: Use WebFetch to load `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/main/README.md`\n- [🐍 Python Implementation Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Python-specific best practices and examples\n\n**For Node/TypeScript implementations, also load:**\n- **TypeScript SDK Documentation**: Use WebFetch to load `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/main/README.md`\n- [⚡ TypeScript Implementation Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - Node/TypeScript-specific best practices and examples\n\n#### 1.5 Exhaustively Study API Documentation\n\nTo integrate a service, read through **ALL** available API documentation:\n- Official API reference documentation\n- Authentication and authorization requirements\n- Rate limiting and pagination patterns\n- Error responses and status codes\n- Available endpoints and their parameters\n- Data models and schemas\n\n**To gather comprehensive information, use web search and the WebFetch tool as needed.**\n\n#### 1.6 Create a Comprehensive Implementation Plan\n\nBased on your research, create a detailed plan that includes:\n\n**Tool Selection:**\n- List the most valuable endpoints/operations to implement\n- Prioritize tools that enable the most common and important use cases\n- Consider which tools work together to enable complex workflows\n\n**Shared Utilities and Helpers:**\n- Identify common API request patterns\n- Plan pagination helpers\n- Design filtering and formatting utilities\n- Plan error handling strategies\n\n**Input/Output Design:**\n- Define input validation models (Pydantic for Python, Zod for TypeScript)\n- Design consistent response formats (e.g., JSON or Markdown), and configurable levels of detail (e.g., Detailed or Concise)\n- Plan for large-scale usage (thousands of users/resources)\n- Implement character limits and truncation strategies (e.g., 25,000 tokens)\n\n**Error Handling Strategy:**\n- Plan graceful failure modes\n- Design clear, actionable, LLM-friendly, natural language error messages which prompt further action\n- Consider rate limiting and timeout scenarios\n- Handle authentication and authorization errors\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Implementation\n\nNow that you have a comprehensive plan, begin implementation following language-specific best practices.\n\n#### 2.1 Set Up Project Structure\n\n**For Python:**\n- Create a single `.py` file or organize into modules if complex (see [🐍 Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md))\n- Use the MCP Python SDK for tool registration\n- Define Pydantic models for input validation\n\n**For Node/TypeScript:**\n- Create proper project structure (see [⚡ TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md))\n- Set up `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`\n- Use MCP TypeScript SDK\n- Define Zod schemas for input validation\n\n#### 2.2 Implement Core Infrastructure First\n\n**To begin implementation, create shared utilities before implementing tools:**\n- API request helper functions\n- Error handling utilities\n- Response formatting functions (JSON and Markdown)\n- Pagination helpers\n- Authentication/token management\n\n#### 2.3 Implement Tools Systematically\n\nFor each tool in the plan:\n\n**Define Input Schema:**\n- Use Pydantic (Python) or Zod (TypeScript) for validation\n- Include proper constraints (min/max length, regex patterns, min/max values, ranges)\n- Provide clear, descriptive field descriptions\n- Include diverse examples in field descriptions\n\n**Write Comprehensive Docstrings/Descriptions:**\n- One-line summary of what the tool does\n- Detailed explanation of purpose and functionality\n- Explicit parameter types with examples\n- Complete return type schema\n- Usage examples (when to use, when not to use)\n- Error handling documentation, which outlines how to proceed given specific errors\n\n**Implement Tool Logic:**\n- Use shared utilities to avoid code duplication\n- Follow async/await patterns for all I/O\n- Implement proper error handling\n- Support multiple response formats (JSON and Markdown)\n- Respect pagination parameters\n- Check character limits and truncate appropriately\n\n**Add Tool Annotations:**\n- `readOnlyHint`: true (for read-only operations)\n- `destructiveHint`: false (for non-destructive operations)\n- `idempotentHint`: true (if repeated calls have same effect)\n- `openWorldHint`: true (if interacting with external systems)\n\n#### 2.4 Follow Language-Specific Best Practices\n\n**At this point, load the appropriate language guide:**\n\n**For Python: Load [🐍 Python Implementation Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) and ensure the following:**\n- Using MCP Python SDK with proper tool registration\n- Pydantic v2 models with `model_config`\n- Type hints throughout\n- Async/await for all I/O operations\n- Proper imports organization\n- Module-level constants (CHARACTER_LIMIT, API_BASE_URL)\n\n**For Node/TypeScript: Load [⚡ TypeScript Implementation Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) and ensure the following:**\n- Using `server.registerTool` properly\n- Zod schemas with `.strict()`\n- TypeScript strict mode enabled\n- No `any` types - use proper types\n- Explicit Promise<T> return types\n- Build process configured (`npm run build`)\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3: Review and Refine\n\nAfter initial implementation:\n\n#### 3.1 Code Quality Review\n\nTo ensure quality, review the code for:\n- **DRY Principle**: No duplicated code between tools\n- **Composability**: Shared logic extracted into functions\n- **Consistency**: Similar operations return similar formats\n- **Error Handling**: All external calls have error handling\n- **Type Safety**: Full type coverage (Python type hints, TypeScript types)\n- **Documentation**: Every tool has comprehensive docstrings/descriptions\n\n#### 3.2 Test and Build\n\n**Important:** MCP servers are long-running processes that wait for requests over stdio/stdin or sse/http. Running them directly in your main process (e.g., `python server.py` or `node dist/index.js`) will cause your process to hang indefinitely.\n\n**Safe ways to test the server:**\n- Use the evaluation harness (see Phase 4) - recommended approach\n- Run the server in tmux to keep it outside your main process\n- Use a timeout when testing: `timeout 5s python server.py`\n\n**For Python:**\n- Verify Python syntax: `python -m py_compile your_server.py`\n- Check imports work correctly by reviewing the file\n- To manually test: Run server in tmux, then test with evaluation harness in main process\n- Or use the evaluation harness directly (it manages the server for stdio transport)\n\n**For Node/TypeScript:**\n- Run `npm run build` and ensure it completes without errors\n- Verify dist/index.js is created\n- To manually test: Run server in tmux, then test with evaluation harness in main process\n- Or use the evaluation harness directly (it manages the server for stdio transport)\n\n#### 3.3 Use Quality Checklist\n\nTo verify implementation quality, load the appropriate checklist from the language-specific guide:\n- Python: see \"Quality Checklist\" in [🐍 Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md)\n- Node/TypeScript: see \"Quality Checklist\" in [⚡ TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md)\n\n---\n\n### Phase 4: Create Evaluations\n\nAfter implementing your MCP server, create comprehensive evaluations to test its effectiveness.\n\n**Load [✅ Evaluation Guide](./reference/evaluation.md) for complete evaluation guidelines.**\n\n#### 4.1 Understand Evaluation Purpose\n\nEvaluations test whether LLMs can effectively use your MCP server to answer realistic, complex questions.\n\n#### 4.2 Create 10 Evaluation Questions\n\nTo create effective evaluations, follow the process outlined in the evaluation guide:\n\n1. **Tool Inspection**: List available tools and understand their capabilities\n2. **Content Exploration**: Use READ-ONLY operations to explore available data\n3. **Question Generation**: Create 10 complex, realistic questions\n4. **Answer Verification**: Solve each question yourself to verify answers\n\n#### 4.3 Evaluation Requirements\n\nEach question must be:\n- **Independent**: Not dependent on other questions\n- **Read-only**: Only non-destructive operations required\n- **Complex**: Requiring multiple tool calls and deep exploration\n- **Realistic**: Based on real use cases humans would care about\n- **Verifiable**: Single, clear answer that can be verified by string comparison\n- **Stable**: Answer won't change over time\n\n#### 4.4 Output Format\n\nCreate an XML file with this structure:\n\n```xml\n<evaluation>\n  <qa_pair>\n    <question>Find discussions about AI model launches with animal codenames. One model needed a specific safety designation that uses the format ASL-X.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use at the start of every Claude Code session when the user provides their first prompt, and whenever the user switches to a distinctly new high-level task. Helps developers manage multiple Claude Code terminals by providing clear, at-a-glance identification of what each terminal is working on.\r\nmin_claude_code_version: \"1.0.0\"\r\nversion: \"1.1.0\"\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Terminal Title\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nAutomatically sets descriptive terminal window titles based on the task Claude is working on. Essential for developers running multiple Claude Code instances who need to quickly identify which terminal is handling which task.\r\n\r\n## When to Use\r\n\r\n**Always trigger this skill:**\r\n- At the start of every new Claude Code session (after receiving the first user prompt)\r\n- When switching to a substantially different task (e.g., from \"API Integration\" to \"Database Migration\")\r\n\r\n**Trigger on task switches like these:**\r\n- Switching from frontend work to backend work\r\n- Moving from debugging to new feature development\r\n- Changing from one module/component to a completely different one\r\n- Starting work on a different part of the system (e.g., from auth to payments)\r\n\r\n**Do NOT trigger for:**\r\n- Follow-up questions about the same task (\"Can you add a comment to that function?\")\r\n- Small refinements to current work (\"Make it blue instead of red\")\r\n- Debugging the same feature you just built\r\n- Clarifications (\"What did you mean by X?\")\r\n- Iterating on the same component or module\r\n- Mid-task status updates or progress checks\r\n\r\n## How It Works\r\n\r\n1. **Extract Task Summary**: Analyze the user's prompt to identify the high-level task\r\n2. **Generate Title**: Create a concise, descriptive title (max 40 characters)\r\n3. **Set Title**: Execute the `scripts/set_title.sh` script with the generated title\r\n4. **No Confirmation Needed**: This happens automatically in the background\r\n\r\n## Title Format Guidelines\r\n\r\n**Good titles:**\r\n- \"API Integration: Auth Flow\"\r\n- \"Fix: Login Bug\"\r\n- \"DB Migration: Users Table\"\r\n- \"Build: Dashboard UI\"\r\n- \"Refactor: Payment Module\"\r\n\r\n**Bad titles:**\r\n- Too long: \"Implementing the new authentication system with OAuth2.0 support\" (exceeds 40 chars)\r\n- Too generic: \"Working\" or \"Coding\"\r\n- Too verbose: \"The user wants me to help them with...\"\r\n\r\n**Format pattern:**\r\n```\r\n[Action/Category]: [Specific Focus]\r\n```\r\n\r\nKeep titles concise, actionable, and immediately recognizable.\r\n\r\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\r\n\r\n**❌ Too Verbose:**\r\n- Bad: \"Working on implementing the user authentication system with JWT tokens\"\r\n- Good: \"Build: JWT Auth\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Too Vague:**\r\n- Bad: \"Code stuff\"\r\n- Bad: \"Working\"\r\n- Good: \"Refactor: API Layer\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Including System Information:**\r\n- Bad: \"john-macbook-pro: Debug app\"\r\n- Bad: \"/Users/john/project: Build feature\"\r\n- Good: \"Debug: App Issues\"\r\n\r\n**❌ Using Complete Sentences:**\r\n- Bad: \"I am working on the dashboard component\"\r\n- Good: \"Build: Dashboard UI\"\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n**Execute the title script:**\r\n```bash\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Your Title Here\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# User asks: \"Help me debug the authentication flow in the API\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Debug: Auth API Flow\"\r\n\r\n# User asks: \"Create a React component for the user profile page\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Build: User Profile UI\"\r\n\r\n# User asks: \"Write tests for the payment processing module\"\r\nbash scripts/set_title.sh \"Test: Payment Module\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Script Details\r\n\r\nThe `scripts/set_title.sh` script uses ANSI escape sequences to set the terminal title. It's compatible with:\r\n- macOS Terminal\r\n- iTerm2\r\n- Alacritty\r\n- Most modern terminal emulators (xterm, rxvt, screen, tmux)\r\n\r\nThe script accepts a single argument (the title string) and exits silently if no title is provided (fail-safe behavior).\r\n\r\n## Optional Customization\r\n\r\nUsers can optionally customize terminal titles with a prefix by setting the `CLAUDE_TITLE_PREFIX` environment variable:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport CLAUDE_TITLE_PREFIX=\"🤖 Claude\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis produces titles like: `🤖 Claude | Build: Dashboard UI`\r\n\r\nWithout the prefix, titles remain in the standard format: `Build: Dashboard UI`\r\n\r\n**Note:** You don't need to check for this variable or modify your behavior. The script handles this automatically.\r\n"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Tool Development Best Practices\r\n7. Transport Best Practices\r\n8. Testing Requirements\r\n9. OAuth and Security Best Practices\r\n10. Resource Management Best Practices\r\n11. Prompt Management Best Practices\r\n12. Error Handling Standards\r\n13. Documentation Requirements\r\n14. Compliance and Monitoring\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1. Server Naming Conventions\r\n\r\nFollow these standardized naming patterns for MCP servers:\r\n\r\n**Python**: Use format `{service}_mcp` (lowercase with underscores)\r\n- Examples: `slack_mcp`, `github_mcp`, `jira_mcp`, `stripe_mcp`\r\n\r\n**Node/TypeScript**: Use format `{service}-mcp-server` (lowercase with hyphens)\r\n- Examples: `slack-mcp-server`, `github-mcp-server`, `jira-mcp-server`\r\n\r\nThe name should be:\r\n- General (not tied to specific features)\r\n- Descriptive of the service/API being integrated\r\n- Easy to infer from the task description\r\n- Without version numbers or dates\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Tool Naming and Design\r\n\r\n### Tool Naming Best Practices\r\n\r\n1. **Use snake_case**: `search_users`, `create_project`, `get_channel_info`\r\n2. **Include service prefix**: Anticipate that your MCP server may be used alongside other MCP servers\r\n   - Use `slack_send_message` instead of just `send_message`\r\n   - Use `github_create_issue` instead of just `create_issue`\r\n   - Use `asana_list_tasks` instead of just `list_tasks`\r\n3. **Be action-oriented**: Start with verbs (get, list, search, create, etc.)\r\n4. **Be specific**: Avoid generic names that could conflict with other servers\r\n5. **Maintain consistency**: Use consistent naming patterns within your server\r\n\r\n### Tool Design Guidelines\r\n\r\n- Tool descriptions must narrowly and unambiguously describe functionality\r\n- Descriptions must precisely match actual functionality\r\n- Should not create confusion with other MCP servers\r\n- Should provide tool annotations (readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, idempotentHint, openWorldHint)\r\n- Keep tool operations focused and atomic\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. Response Format Guidelines\r\n\r\nAll tools that return data should support multiple formats for flexibility:\r\n\r\n### JSON Format (`response_format=\"json\"`)\r\n- Machine-readable structured data\r\n- Include all available fields and metadata\r\n- Consistent field names and types\r\n- Suitable for programmatic processing\r\n- Use for when LLMs need to process data further\r\n\r\n### Markdown Format (`response_format=\"markdown\"`, typically default)\r\n- Human-readable formatted text\r\n- Use headers, lists, and formatting for clarity\r\n- Convert timestamps to human-readable format (e.g., \"2024-01-15 10:30:00 UTC\" instead of epoch)\r\n- Show display names with IDs in parentheses (e.g., \"@john.doe (U123456)\")\r\n- Omit verbose metadata (e.g., show only one profile image URL, not all sizes)\r\n- Group related information logically\r\n- Use for when presenting information to users\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4. Pagination Best Practices\r\n\r\nFor tools that list resources:\r\n\r\n- **Always respect the `limit` parameter**: Never load all results when a limit is specified\r\n- **Implement pagination**: Use `offset` or cursor-based pagination\r\n- **Return pagination metadata**: Include `has_more`, `next_offset`/`next_cursor`, `total_count`\r\n- **Never load all results into memory**: Especially important for large datasets\r\n- **Default to reasonable limits**: 20-50 items is typical\r\n- **Include clear pagination info in responses**: Make it easy for LLMs to request more data\r\n\r\nExample pagination response structure:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"total\": 150,\r\n  \"count\": 20,\r\n  \"offset\": 0,\r\n  \"items\": [...],\r\n  \"has_more\": true,\r\n  \"next_offset\": 20\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5. Character Limits and Truncation\r\n\r\nTo prevent overwhelming responses with too much data:\r\n\r\n- **Define CHARACTER_LIMIT constant**: Typically 25,000 characters at module level\r\n- **Check response size before returning**: Measure the final response length\r\n- **Truncate gracefully with clear indicators**: Let the LLM know data was truncated\r\n- **Provide guidance on filtering**: Suggest how to use parameters to reduce results\r\n- **Include truncation metadata**: Show what was truncated and how to get more\r\n\r\nExample truncation handling:\r\n```python\r\nCHARACTER_LIMIT = 25000\r\n\r\nif len(result) > CHARACTER_LIMIT:\r\n    truncated_data = data[:max(1, len(data) // 2)]\r\n    response[\"truncated\"] = True\r\n    response[\"truncation_message\"] = (\r\n        f\"Response truncated from {len(data)} to {len(truncated_data)} items. \"\r\n        f\"Use 'offset' parameter or add filters to see more results.\"\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 6. Transport Options\r\n\r\nMCP servers support multiple transport mechanisms for different deployment scenarios:\r\n\r\n### Stdio Transport\r\n\r\n**Best for**: Command-line tools, local integrations, subprocess execution\r\n\r\n**Characteristics**:\r\n- Standard input/output stream communication\r\n- Simple setup, no network configuration needed\r\n- Runs as a subprocess of the client\r\n- Ideal for desktop applications and CLI tools\r\r\n\r\n**Use when**:\r\n- Building tools for local development environments\r\n- Integrating with desktop applications (e.g., Claude Desktop)\r\n- Creating command-line utilities\r\n- Single-user, single-session scenarios\r\n\r\n### HTTP Transport\r\n\r\n**Best for**: Web services, remote access, multi-client scenarios\r\n\r\n**Characteristics**:\r\n- Request-response pattern over HTTP\r\n- Supports multiple simultaneous clients\r\n- Can be deployed as a web service\r\n- Requires network configuration and security considerations\r\n\r\n**Use when**:\r\n- Serving multiple clients simultaneously\r\n- Deploying as a cloud service\r\n- Integration with web applications\r\n- Need for load balancing or scaling\r\n\r\n### Server-Sent Events (SSE) Transport\r\n\r\n**Best for**: Real-time updates, push notifications, streaming data\r\n\r\n**Characteristics**:\r\n- One-way server-to-client streaming over HTTP\r\n- Enables real-time updates without polling\r\n- Long-lived connections for continuous data flow\r\n- Built on standard HTTP infrastructure\r\n\r\n**Use when**:\r\n- Clients need real-time data updates\r\n- Implementing push notifications\r\n- Streaming logs or monitoring data\r\n- Progressive result delivery for long operations\r\n\r\n### Transport Selection Criteria\r\n\r\n| Criterion | Stdio | HTTP | SSE |\r\n|-----------|-------|------|-----|\r\n| **Deployment** | Local | Remote | Remote |\r\n| **Clients** | Single | Multiple | Multiple |\r\n| **Communication** | Bidirectional | Request-Response | Server-Push |\r\n| **Complexity** | Low | Medium | Medium-High |\r\n| **Real-time** | No | No | Yes |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 7.

Error Handling Standards\r\n\r\n- Use standard JSON-RPC error codes\r\n- Report tool errors within result objects (not protocol-level)\r\n- Provide helpful, specific error messages\r\n- Don't expose internal implementation details\r\n- Clean up resources properly on errors\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 14. Documentation Requirements\r\n\r\n- Provide clear documentation of all tools and capabilities\r\n- Include working examples (at least 3 per major feature)\r\n- Document security considerations\r\n- Specify required permissions and access levels\r\n- Document rate limits and performance characteristics\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 15. Compliance and Monitoring\r\n\r\n- Implement logging for debugging and monitoring\r\n- Track tool usage patterns\r\n- Monitor for potential abuse\r\n- Maintain audit trails for security-relevant operations\r\r\n- Be prepared for ongoing compliance reviews\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThese best practices represent the comprehensive guidelines for building secure, efficient, and compliant MCP servers that work well within the ecosystem. Developers should follow these guidelines to ensure their MCP servers meet the standards for inclusion in the MCP directory and provide a safe, reliable experience for users.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n# Tools\r\n\r\n> Enable LLMs to perform actions through your server\r\n\r\nTools are a powerful primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enable servers to expose executable functionality to clients. Through tools, LLMs can interact with external systems, perform computations, and take actions in the real world.\r\n\r\n<Note>\r\n  Tools are designed to be **model-controlled**, meaning that tools are exposed from servers to clients with the intention of the AI model being able to automatically invoke them (with a human in the loop to grant approval).\r\n</Note>\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nTools in MCP allow servers to expose executable functions that can be invoked by clients and used by LLMs to perform actions. Key aspects of tools include:\r\n\r\n* **Discovery**: Clients can obtain a list of available tools by sending a `tools/list` request\r\n* **Invocation**: Tools are called using the `tools/call` request, where servers perform the requested operation and return results\r\n* **Flexibility**: Tools can range from simple calculations to complex API interactions\r\n\r\nLike [resources](/docs/concepts/resources), tools are identified by unique names and can include descriptions to guide their usage. However, unlike resources, tools represent dynamic operations that can modify state or interact with external systems.\r\n\r\n## Tool definition structure\r\n\r\nEach tool is defined with the following structure:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n{\r\n  name: string;          // Unique identifier for the tool\r\n  description?: string;  // Human-readable description\r\n  inputSchema: {         // JSON Schema for the tool's parameters\r\n    type: \"object\",\r\n    properties: { ... }  // Tool-specific parameters\r\n  },\r\n  annotations?: {        // Optional hints about tool behavior\r\n    title?: string;      // Human-readable title for the tool\r\n    readOnlyHint?: boolean;    // If true, the tool does not modify its environment\r\n    destructiveHint?: boolean; // If true, the tool may perform destructive updates\r\n    idempotentHint?: boolean;  // If true, repeated calls with same args have no additional effect\r\n    openWorldHint?: boolean;   // If true, tool interacts with external entities\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Implementing tools\r\n\r\nHere's an example of implementing a basic tool in an MCP server:\r\n\r\n<Tabs>\r\n  <Tab title=\"TypeScript\">\r\n    ```typescript\r\n    const server = new Server({\r\n      name: \"example-server\",\r\n      version: \"1.0.0\"\r\n    }, {\r\n      capabilities: {\r\n        tools: {}\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    // Define available tools\r\n    server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => {\r\n      return {\r\n        tools: [{\r\n          name: \"calculate_sum\",\r\n          description: \"Add two numbers together\",\r\n          inputSchema: {\r\n            type: \"object\",\r\n            properties: {\r\n              a: { type: \"number\" },\r\n              b: { type: \"number\" }\r\n            },\r\n            required: [\"a\", \"b\"]\r\n          }\r\n        }]\r\n      };\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    // Handle tool execution\r\n    server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request) => {\r\n      if (request.params.name === \"calculate_sum\") {\r\n        const { a, b } = request.params.arguments;\r\n        return {\r\n          content: [\r\n            {\r\n              type: \"text\",\r\n              text: String(a + b)\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        };\r\n      }\r\n      throw new Error(\"Tool not found\");\r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n  </Tab>\r\n\r\n  <Tab title=\"Python\">\r\n    ```python\r\n    app = Server(\"example-server\")\r\n\r\n    @app.list_tools()\r\n    async def list_tools() -> list[types.Tool]:\r\n        return [\r\n            types.Tool(\r\n                name=\"calculate_sum\",\r\n                description=\"Add two numbers together\",\r\n                inputSchema={\r\n                    \"type\": \"object\",\r\n                    \"properties\": {\r\n                        \"a\": {\"type\": \"number\"},\r\n                        \"b\": {\"type\": \"number\"}\r\n                    },\r\n                    \"required\": [\"a\", \"b\"]\r\n                }\r\n            )\r\n        ]\r\n\r\n    @app.call_tool()\r\n    async def call_tool(\r\n        name: str,\r\n        arguments: dict\r\n    ) -> list[types.TextContent | types.ImageContent | types.EmbeddedResource]:\r\n        if name == \"calculate_sum\":\r\n            a = arguments[\"a\"]\r\n            b = arguments[\"b\"]\r\n            result = a + b\r\n            return [types.TextContent(type=\"text\", text=str(result))]\r\n        raise ValueError(f\"Tool not found: {name}\")\r\n    ```\r\n  </Tab>\r\n</Tabs>\r\n\r\n## Example tool patterns\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of types of tools that a server could provide:\r\n\r\n### System operations\r\n\r\nTools that interact with the local system:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n{\r\n  name: \"execute_command\",\r\n  description: \"Run a shell command\",\r\n  inputSchema: {\r\n    type: \"object\",\r\n    properties: {\r\n      command: { type: \"string\" },\r\n      args: { type: \"array\", items: { type: \"string\" } }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### API integrations\r\n\r\nTools that wrap external APIs:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n{\r\n  name: \"github_create_issue\",\r\n  description: \"Create a GitHub issue\",\r\n  inputSchema: {\r\n    type: \"object\",\r\n    properties: {\r\n      title: { type: \"string\" },\r\n      body: { type: \"string\" },\r\n      labels: { type: \"array\", items: { type: \"string\" } }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Data processing\r\n\r\nTools that transform or analyze data:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n{\r\n  name: \"analyze_csv\",\r\n  description: \"Analyze a CSV file\",\r\n  inputSchema: {\r\n    type: \"object\",\r\n    properties: {\r\n      filepath: { type: \"string\" },\r\n      operations: {\r\n        type: \"array\",\r\n        items: {\r\n          enum: [\"sum\", \"average\", \"count\"]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Best practices\r\n\r\nWhen implementing tools:\r\n\r\n1. Provide clear, descriptive names and descriptions\r\n2. Use detailed JSON Schema definitions for parameters\r\n3. Include examples in tool descriptions to demonstrate how the model should use them\r\n4. Implement proper error handling and validation\r\n5. Use progress reporting for long operations\r\n6. Keep tool operations focused and atomic\r\n7. Document expected return value structures\r\n8. Implement proper timeouts\r\n9. Consider rate limiting for resource-intensive operations\r\n10. Log tool usage for debugging and monitoring\r\n\r\n### Tool name conflicts\r\n\r\nMCP client applications and MCP server proxies may encounter tool name conflicts when building their own tool lists. For example, two connected MCP servers `web1` and `web2` may both expose a tool named `search_web`.\r\n\r\nApplications may disambiguiate tools with one of the following strategies (among others; not an exhaustive list):\r\n\r\n* Concatenating a unique, user-defined server name with the tool name, e.g. `web1___search_web` and `web2___search_web`. This strategy may be preferable when unique server names are already provided by the user in a configuration file.\r\n* Generating a random prefix for the tool name, e.g. `jrwxs___search_web` and `6cq52___search_web`. This strategy may be preferable in server proxies where user-defined unique names are not available.\r\n* Using the server URI as a prefix for the tool name, e.g. `web1.example.com:search_web` and `web2.example.com:search_web`. This strategy may be suitable when working with remote MCP servers.\r\n\r\nNote that the server-provided name from the initialization flow is not guaranteed to be unique and is not generally suitable for disambiguation purposes.\r\n\r\n## Security considerations\r\n\r\nWhen exposing tools:\r\n\r\n### Input validation\r\n\r\n* Validate all parameters against the schema\r\n* Sanitize file paths and system commands\r\n* Validate URLs and external identifiers\r\n* Check parameter sizes and ranges\r\n* Prevent command injection\r\n\r\n### Access control\r\n\r\n* Implement authentication where needed\r\n* Use appropriate authorization checks\r\n* Audit tool usage\r\n* Rate limit requests\r\n* Monitor for abuse\r\n\r\n### Error handling\r\n\r\n* Don't expose internal errors to clients\r\n* Log security-relevant errors\r\n* Handle timeouts appropriately\r\n* Clean up resources after errors\r\n* Validate return values\r\n\r\n## Tool discovery and updates\r\n\r\nMCP supports dynamic tool discovery:\r\n\r\n1. Clients can list available tools at any time\r\n2. Servers can notify clients when tools change using `notifications/tools/list_changed`\r\n3. Tools can be added or removed during runtime\r\n4. Tool definitions can be updated (though this should be done carefully)\r\n\r\n## Error handling\r\n\r\nTool errors should be reported within the result object, not as MCP protocol-level errors. This allows the LLM to see and potentially handle the error. When a tool encounters an error:\r\n\r\n1. Set `isError` to `true` in the result\r\n2. Include error details in the `content` array\r\n\r\nHere's an example of proper error handling for tools:\r\n\r\n<Tabs>\r\n  <Tab title=\"TypeScript\">\r\n    ```typescript\r\n    try {\r\n      // Tool operation\r\n      const result = performOperation();\r\n      return {\r\n        content: [\r\n          {\r\n            type: \"text\",\r\n            text: `Operation successful: ${result}`\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      };\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n      return {\r\n        isError: true,\r\n        content: [\r\n          {\r\n            type: \"text\",\r\n            text: `Error: ${error.message}`\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      };\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n  </Tab>\r\n\r\n  <Tab title=\"Python\">\r\n    ```python\r\n    try:\r\n        # Tool operation\r\n        result = perform_operation()\r\n        return types.CallToolResult(\r\n            content=[\r\n                types.TextContent(\r\n                    type=\"text\",\r\n                    text=f\"Operation successful: {result}\"\r\n                )\r\n            ]\r\n        )\r\n    except Exception as error:\r\n        return types.CallToolResult(\r\n            isError=True,\r\n            content=[\r\n                types.TextContent(\r\n                    type=\"text\",\r\n                    text=f\"Error: {str(error)}\"\r\n                )\r\n            ]\r\n        )\r\n    ```\r\n  </Tab>\r\n</Tabs>\r\n\r\nThis approach allows the LLM to see that an error occurred and potentially take corrective action or request human intervention.\r\n\r\n## Tool annotations\r\n\r\nTool annotations provide additional metadata about a tool's behavior, helping clients understand how to present and manage tools. These annotations are hints that describe the nature and impact of a tool, but should not be relied upon for security decisions.\r\n\r\n### Purpose of tool annotations\r\n\r\nTool annotations serve several key purposes:\r\n\r\n1.

Assist in developing intuitive interfaces for tool approval\r\n\r\n### Available tool annotations\r\n\r\nThe MCP specification defines the following annotations for tools:\r\n\r\n| Annotation        | Type    | Default | Description                                                                                                                          |\r\n| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\r\n| `title`           | string  | -       | A human-readable title for the tool, useful for UI display                                                                           |\r\n| `readOnlyHint`    | boolean | false   | If true, indicates the tool does not modify its environment                                                                          |\r\n| `destructiveHint` | boolean | true    | If true, the tool may perform destructive updates (only meaningful when `readOnlyHint` is false)                                     |\r\n| `idempotentHint`  | boolean | false   | If true, calling the tool repeatedly with the same arguments has no additional effect (only meaningful when `readOnlyHint` is false) |\r\n| `openWorldHint`   | boolean | true    | If true, the tool may interact with an \"open world\" of external entities                                                             |\r\n\r\n### Example usage\r\n\r\nHere's how to define tools with annotations for different scenarios:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// A read-only search tool\r\n{\r\n  name: \"web_search\",\r\n  description: \"Search the web for information\",\r\n  inputSchema: {\r\n    type: \"object\",\r\n    properties: {\r\n      query: { type: \"string\" }\r\n    },\r\n    required: [\"query\"]\r\n  },\r\n  annotations: {\r\n    title: \"Web Search\",\r\n    readOnlyHint: true,\r\n    openWorldHint: true\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// A destructive file deletion tool\r\n{\r\n  name: \"delete_file\",\r\n  description: \"Delete a file from the filesystem\",\r\n  inputSchema: {\r\n    type: \"object\",\r\n    properties: {\r\n      path: { type: \"string\" }\r\n    },\r\n    required: [\"path\"]\r\n  },\r\n  annotations: {\r\n    title: \"Delete File\",\r\n    readOnlyHint: false,\r\n    destructiveHint: true,\r\n    idempotentHint: true,\r\n    openWorldHint: false\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// A non-destructive database record creation tool\r\n{\r\n  name: \"create_record\",\r\n  description: \"Create a new record in the database\",\r\n  inputSchema: {\r\n    type: \"object\",\r\n    properties: {\r\n      table: { type: \"string\" },\r\n      data: { type: \"object\" }\r\n    },\r\n    required: [\"table\", \"data\"]\r\n  },\r\n  annotations: {\r\n    title: \"Create Database Record\",\r\n    readOnlyHint: false,\r\n    destructiveHint: false,\r\n    idempotentHint: false,\r\n    openWorldHint: false\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Integrating annotations in server implementation\r\n\r\n<Tabs>\r\n  <Tab title=\"TypeScript\">\r\n    ```typescript\r\n    server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => {\r\n      return {\r\n        tools: [{\r\n          name: \"calculate_sum\",\r\n          description: \"Add two numbers together\",\r\n          inputSchema: {\r\n            type: \"object\",\r\n            properties: {\r\n              a: { type: \"number\" },\r\n              b: { type: \"number\" }\r\n            },\r\n            required: [\"a\", \"b\"]\r\n          },\r\n          annotations: {\r\n            title: \"Calculate Sum\",\r\n            readOnlyHint: true,\r\n            openWorldHint: false\r\n          }\r\n        }]\r\n      };\r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n  </Tab>\r\n\r\n  <Tab title=\"Python\">\r\n    ```python\r\n    from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\r\n\r\n    mcp = FastMCP(\"example-server\")\r\n\r\n    @mcp.tool(\r\n        annotations={\r\n            \"title\": \"Calculate Sum\",\r\n            \"readOnlyHint\": True,\r\n            \"openWorldHint\": False\r\n        }\r\n    )\r\n    async def calculate_sum(a: float, b: float) -> str:\r\n        \"\"\"Add two numbers together.\r\n\r\n        Args:\r\n            a: First number to add\r\n            b: Second number to add\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        result = a + b\r\n        return str(result)\r\n    ```\r\n  </Tab>\r\n</Tabs>\r\n\r\n### Best practices for tool annotations\r\n\r\n1. **Be accurate about side effects**: Clearly indicate whether a tool modifies its environment and whether those modifications are destructive.\r\n\r\n2. **Use descriptive titles**: Provide human-friendly titles that clearly describe the tool's purpose.\r\n\r\n3. **Indicate idempotency properly**: Mark tools as idempotent only if repeated calls with the same arguments truly have no additional effect.\r\n\r\n4. **Set appropriate open/closed world hints**: Indicate whether a tool interacts with a closed system (like a database) or an open system (like the web).\r\n\r\n5. **Remember annotations are hints**: All properties in ToolAnnotations are hints and not guaranteed to provide a faithful description of tool behavior. Clients should never make security-critical decisions based solely on annotations.\r\n\r\n## Testing tools\r\n\r\nA comprehensive testing strategy for MCP tools should cover:\r\n\r\n* **Functional testing**: Verify tools execute correctly with valid inputs and handle invalid inputs appropriately\r\n* **Integration testing**: Test tool interaction with external systems using both real and mocked dependencies\r\n* **Security testing**: Validate authentication, authorization, input sanitization, and rate limiting\r\n* **Performance testing**: Check behavior under load, timeout handling, and resource cleanup\r\n* **Error handling**: Ensure tools properly report errors through the MCP protocol and clean up resources\r\n"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

It covers project structure, server setup, tool registration patterns, input validation with Zod, error handling, and complete working examples.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Quick Reference\r\n\r\n### Key Imports\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { McpServer } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js\";\r\nimport { StdioServerTransport } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js\";\r\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\r\nimport axios, { AxiosError } from \"axios\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Server Initialization\r\n```typescript\r\nconst server = new McpServer({\r\n  name: \"service-mcp-server\",\r\n  version: \"1.0.0\"\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tool Registration Pattern\r\n```typescript\r\nserver.registerTool(\"tool_name\", {...config}, async (params) => {\r\n  // Implementation\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## MCP TypeScript SDK\r\n\r\nThe official MCP TypeScript SDK provides:\r\n- `McpServer` class for server initialization\r\n- `registerTool` method for tool registration\r\n- Zod schema integration for runtime input validation\r\n- Type-safe tool handler implementations\r\n\r\nSee the MCP SDK documentation in the references for complete details.\r\n\r\n## Server Naming Convention\r\n\r\nNode/TypeScript MCP servers must follow this naming pattern:\r\n- **Format**: `{service}-mcp-server` (lowercase with hyphens)\r\n- **Examples**: `github-mcp-server`, `jira-mcp-server`, `stripe-mcp-server`\r\n\r\nThe name should be:\r\n- General (not tied to specific features)\r\n- Descriptive of the service/API being integrated\r\n- Easy to infer from the task description\r\n- Without version numbers or dates\r\n\r\n## Project Structure\r\n\r\nCreate the following structure for Node/TypeScript MCP servers:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{service}-mcp-server/\r\n├── package.json\r\n├── tsconfig.json\r\n├── README.md\r\n├── src/\r\n│   ├── index.ts          # Main entry point with McpServer initialization\r\n│   ├── types.ts          # TypeScript type definitions and interfaces\r\n│   ├── tools/            # Tool implementations (one file per domain)\r\n│   ├── services/         # API clients and shared utilities\r\n│   ├── schemas/          # Zod validation schemas\r\n│   └── constants.ts      # Shared constants (API_URL, CHARACTER_LIMIT, etc.)\r\n└── dist/                 # Built JavaScript files (entry point: dist/index.js)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tool Implementation\r\n\r\n### Tool Naming\r\n\r\nUse snake_case for tool names (e.g., \"search_users\", \"create_project\", \"get_channel_info\") with clear, action-oriented names.\r\n\r\n**Avoid Naming Conflicts**: Include the service context to prevent overlaps:\r\n- Use \"slack_send_message\" instead of just \"send_message\"\r\n- Use \"github_create_issue\" instead of just \"create_issue\"\r\n- Use \"asana_list_tasks\" instead of just \"list_tasks\"\r\n\r\n### Tool Structure\r\n\r\nTools are registered using the `registerTool` method with the following requirements:\r\n- Use Zod schemas for runtime input validation and type safety\r\n- The `description` field must be explicitly provided - JSDoc comments are NOT automatically extracted\r\n- Explicitly provide `title`, `description`, `inputSchema`, and `annotations`\r\n- The `inputSchema` must be a Zod schema object (not a JSON schema)\r\n- Type all parameters and return values explicitly\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { McpServer } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js\";\r\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\r\n\r\nconst server = new McpServer({\r\n  name: \"example-mcp\",\r\n  version: \"1.0.0\"\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Zod schema for input validation\r\nconst UserSearchInputSchema = z.object({\r\n  query: z.string()\r\n    .min(2, \"Query must be at least 2 characters\")\r\n    .max(200, \"Query must not exceed 200 characters\")\r\n    .describe(\"Search string to match against names/emails\"),\r\n  limit: z.number()\r\n    .int()\r\n    .min(1)\r\n    .max(100)\r\n    .default(20)\r\n    .describe(\"Maximum results to return\"),\r\n  offset: z.number()\r\n    .int()\r\n    .min(0)\r\n    .default(0)\r\n    .describe(\"Number of results to skip for pagination\"),\r\n  response_format: z.nativeEnum(ResponseFormat)\r\n    .default(ResponseFormat.MARKDOWN)\r\n    .describe(\"Output format: 'markdown' for human-readable or 'json' for machine-readable\")\r\n}).strict();\r\n\r\n// Type definition from Zod schema\r\ntype UserSearchInput = z.infer<typeof UserSearchInputSchema>;\r\n\r\nserver.registerTool(\r\n  \"example_search_users\",\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Search Example Users\",\r\n    description: `Search for users in the Example system by name, email, or team.\r\n\r\nThis tool searches across all user profiles in the Example platform, supporting partial matches and various search filters.

 // Harder to read and maintain\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## TypeScript Best Practices\r\n\r\n1. **Use Strict TypeScript**: Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json\r\n2. **Define Interfaces**: Create clear interface definitions for all data structures\r\n3. **Avoid `any`**: Use proper types or `unknown` instead of `any`\r\n4. **Zod for Runtime Validation**: Use Zod schemas to validate external data\r\n5. **Type Guards**: Create type guard functions for complex type checking\r\n6. **Error Handling**: Always use try-catch with proper error type checking\r\n7. **Null Safety**: Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`)\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// Good: Type-safe with Zod and interfaces\r\ninterface UserResponse {\r\n  id: string;\r\n  name: string;\r\n  email: string;\r\n  team?: string;\r\n  active: boolean;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst UserSchema = z.object({\r\n  id: z.string(),\r\n  name: z.string(),\r\n  email: z.string().email(),\r\n  team: z.string().optional(),\r\n  active: z.boolean()\r\n});\r\n\r\ntype User = z.infer<typeof UserSchema>;\r\n\r\nasync function getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {\r\n  const data = await apiCall(`/users/${id}`);\r\n  return UserSchema.parse(data);  // Runtime validation\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Bad: Using any\r\nasync function getUser(id: string): Promise<any> {\r\n  return await apiCall(`/users/${id}`);  // No type safety\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Package Configuration\r\n\r\n### package.json\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"{service}-mcp-server\",\r\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\r\n  \"description\": \"MCP server for {Service} API integration\",\r\n  \"type\": \"module\",\r\n  \"main\": \"dist/index.js\",\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"start\": \"node dist/index.js\",\r\n    \"dev\": \"tsx watch src/index.ts\",\r\n    \"build\": \"tsc\",\r\n    \"clean\": \"rm -rf dist\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"engines\": {\r\n    \"node\": \">=18\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk\": \"^1.6.1\",\r\n    \"axios\": \"^1.7.9\",\r\n    \"zod\": \"^3.23.8\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@types/node\": \"^22.10.0\",\r\n    \"tsx\": \"^4.19.2\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"^5.7.2\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### tsconfig.json\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"target\": \"ES2022\",\r\n    \"module\": \"Node16\",\r\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"Node16\",\r\n    \"lib\": [\"ES2022\"],\r\n    \"outDir\": \"./dist\",\r\n    \"rootDir\": \"./src\",\r\n    \"strict\": true,\r\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\r\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\r\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\r\n    \"declaration\": true,\r\n    \"declarationMap\": true,\r\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\r\n    \"allowSyntheticDefaultImports\": true\r\n  },\r\n  \"include\": [\"src/**/*\"],\r\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\", \"dist\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Complete Example\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n#!/usr/bin/env node\r\n/**\r\n * MCP Server for Example Service.\r\n *\r\n * This server provides tools to interact with Example API, including user search,\r\n * project management, and data export capabilities.\r\n */\r\n\r\nimport { McpServer } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js\";\r\nimport { StdioServerTransport } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js\";\r\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\r\nimport axios, { AxiosError } from \"axios\";\r\n\r\n// Constants\r\nconst API_BASE_URL = \"https://api.example.com/v1\";\r\nconst CHARACTER_LIMIT = 25000;\r\n\r\n// Enums\r\nenum ResponseFormat {\r\n  MARKDOWN = \"markdown\",\r\n  JSON = \"json\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Zod schemas\r\nconst UserSearchInputSchema = z.object({\r\n  query: z.string()\r\n    .min(2, \"Query must be at least 2 characters\")\r\n    .max(200, \"Query must not exceed 200 characters\")\r\n    .describe(\"Search string to match against names/emails\"),\r\n  limit: z.number()\r\n    .int()\r\n    .min(1)\r\n    .max(100)\r\n    .default(20)\r\n    .describe(\"Maximum results to return\"),\r\n  offset: z.number()\r\n    .int()\r\n    .min(0)\r\n    .default(0)\r\n    .describe(\"Number of results to skip for pagination\"),\r\n  response_format: z.nativeEnum(ResponseFormat)\r\n    .default(ResponseFormat.MARKDOWN)\r\n    .describe(\"Output format: 'markdown' for human-readable or 'json' for machine-readable\")\r\n}).strict();\r\n\r\ntype UserSearchInput = z.infer<typeof UserSearchInputSchema>;\r\n\r\n// Shared utility functions\r\nasync function makeApiRequest<T>(\r\n  endpoint: string,\r\n  method: \"GET\" | \"POST\" | \"PUT\" | \"DELETE\" = \"GET\",\r\n  data?: any,\r\n  params?: any\r\n): Promise<T> {\r\n  try {\r\n    const response = await axios({\r\n      method,\r\n      url: `${API_BASE_URL}/${endpoint}`,\r\n      data,\r\n      params,\r\n      timeout: 30000,\r\n      headers: {\r\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\r\n        \"Accept\": \"application/json\"\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n    return response.data;\r\n  } catch (error) {\r\n    throw error;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction handleApiError(error: unknown): string {\r\n  if (error instanceof AxiosError) {\r\n    if (error.response) {\r\n      switch (error.response.status) {\r\n        case 404:\r\n          return \"Error: Resource not found.

only when server capabilities genuinely change.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Code Best Practices\r\n\r\n### Code Composability and Reusability\r\n\r\nYour implementation MUST prioritize composability and code reuse:\r\n\r\n1. **Extract Common Functionality**:\r\n   - Create reusable helper functions for operations used across multiple tools\r\n   - Build shared API clients for HTTP requests instead of duplicating code\r\n   - Centralize error handling logic in utility functions\r\n   - Extract business logic into dedicated functions that can be composed\r\n   - Extract shared markdown or JSON field selection & formatting functionality\r\n\r\n2. **Avoid Duplication**:\r\n   - NEVER copy-paste similar code between tools\r\n   - If you find yourself writing similar logic twice, extract it into a function\r\n   - Common operations like pagination, filtering, field selection, and formatting should be shared\r\n   - Authentication/authorization logic should be centralized\r\n\r\n## Building and Running\r\n\r\nAlways build your TypeScript code before running:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Build the project\r\nnpm run build\r\n\r\n# Run the server\r\nnpm start\r\n\r\n# Development with auto-reload\r\nnpm run dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlways ensure `npm run build` completes successfully before considering the implementation complete.\r\n\r\n## Quality Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore finalizing your Node/TypeScript MCP server implementation, ensure:\r\n\r\n### Strategic Design\r\n- [ ] Tools enable complete workflows, not just API endpoint wrappers\r\n- [ ] Tool names reflect natural task subdivisions\r\n- [ ] Response formats optimize for agent context efficiency\r\n- [ ] Human-readable identifiers used where appropriate\r\n- [ ] Error messages guide agents toward correct usage\r\n\r\n### Implementation Quality\r\n- [ ] FOCUSED IMPLEMENTATION: Most important and valuable tools implemented\r\n- [ ] All tools registered using `registerTool` with complete configuration\r\n- [ ] All tools include `title`, `description`, `inputSchema`, and `annotations`\r\n- [ ] Annotations correctly set (readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, idempotentHint, openWorldHint)\r\n- [ ] All tools use Zod schemas for runtime input validation with `.strict()` enforcement\r\n- [ ] All Zod schemas have proper constraints and descriptive error messages\r\n- [ ] All tools have comprehensive descriptions with explicit input/output types\r\n- [ ] Descriptions include return value examples and complete schema documentation\r\n- [ ] Error messages are clear, actionable, and educational\r\n\r\n### TypeScript Quality\r\n- [ ] TypeScript interfaces are defined for all data structures\r\n- [ ] Strict TypeScript is enabled in tsconfig.json\r\n- [ ] No use of `any` type -

Use this skill when the user asks to download, save, or grab YouTube videos. Supports various quality settings (best, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p), multiple formats (mp4, webm, mkv), and audio-only downloads as MP3. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/video-downloader/SKILL.md)\n- youtube-transcript: Download YouTube video transcripts when user provides a YouTube URL or asks to download/get/fetch a transcript from YouTube. Also use when user wants to transcribe or get captions/subtitles from a YouTube video. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/youtube-transcript/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/claude-code-terminal-title/SKILL.md)\n- test-driven-development: Use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md)\n- test-fixing: Run tests and systematically fix all failing tests using smart error grouping. Use when user asks to fix failing tests, mentions test failures, runs test suite and failures occur, or requests to make tests pass. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/test-fixing/SKILL.md)\n- theme-factory: Toolkit for styling artifacts with a theme. These artifacts can be slides, docs, reportings, HTML landing pages, etc. There are 10 pre-set themes with colors/fonts that you can apply to any artifact that has been creating, or can generate a new theme on-the-fly. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/theme-factory/SKILL.md)\n- timeline-creator: Create HTML timelines and project roadmaps with Gantt charts, milestones, phase groupings, and progress indicators. Use when users request timelines, roadmaps, Gantt charts, project schedules, or milestone visualizations. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/timeline-creator/SKILL.md)\n- ui-ux-a11y-static-review: This skill should be used when performing static UI/UX and accessibility reviews of frontend codebases and producing a three-step report (context mapping, violations, executive synthesis) from code only. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/ui-ux-a11y-static-review/SKILL.md)\n- using-git-worktrees: Use when starting feature work that needs isolation from current workspace or before executing implementation plans - creates isolated git worktrees with smart directory selection and safety verification (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md)\n- uv-package-manager: Master the uv package manager for fast Python dependency management, virtual environments, and modern Python project workflows. Use when setting up Python projects, managing dependencies, or optimizing Python development workflows with uv. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/uv-package-manager/SKILL.md)\n- webapp-testing: Toolkit for interacting with and testing local web applications using Playwright. Supports verifying frontend functionality, debugging UI behavior, capturing browser screenshots, and viewing browser logs. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/webapp-testing/SKILL.md)\n- xlsx: Comprehensive spreadsheet creation, editing, and analysis with support for formulas, formatting, data analysis, and visualization. When Claude needs to work with spreadsheets (.xlsx, .xlsm, .csv, .tsv, etc) for: (1) Creating new spreadsheets with formulas and formatting, (2) Reading or analyzing data, (3) Modify existing spreadsheets while preserving formulas, (4) Data analysis and visualization in spreadsheets, or (5) Recalculating formulas (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/xlsx/SKILL.md)\n- youtube-downloader: Download YouTube videos with customizable quality and format options. Use this skill when the user asks to download, save, or grab YouTube videos. Supports various quality settings (best, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p), multiple formats (mp4, webm, mkv), and audio-only downloads as MP3. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/video-downloader/SKILL.md)\n- youtube-transcript: Download YouTube video transcripts when user provides a YouTube URL or asks to download/get/fetch a transcript from YouTube. Also use when user wants to transcribe or get captions/subtitles from a YouTube video. (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/youtube-transcript/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/gabrielramos/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
